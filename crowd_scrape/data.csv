3, Codey Rocky has been through 3 generation of prototypes, and now it's steady and works well as you can see in the videos, but we're exploring further functions on it as we hope it can become a more powerful coding learning tool, for the moment it goes as expected, and we will keep updating the progress here for you to know. :)
BR,;Can I pledge 98$ for 2xCodey ?;Hi @makeblock, I just backed a Codey. Like to check a couple of things:

And we don't mean that in a ""woo woo"" sense. We mean it in a purely scientific sense. Here are just some of the benefits studies have shown meditation to have:Plus, meditation is super trendy right now and all your friends are doing it...If we hit $30K, we'll put on a FREE 30-minute meditation session for ALL backers!IQ Bars are the first nutrition bars on the market optimized for the brain. Aside from tasting 10X better than other bars (objectively, of course), only IQ Bars center on these 3 pillars of awesomeness:Ok, those are the SparkNotes. Let's dig a bit deeper...   Carbs are great...if you're climbing Mount Kilimanjaro. For the 99.999% of time you're NOT doing that, your brain and body operates more efficiently on smooth-burning healthy fats.That's why IQ Bars are packed with healthy fats and contain just 8-9g of net carbs per bar. We also included 12g of fiber/bar to slow the absorption of those net carbs. Here's how our macro-nutritional profile stacks up with other bars:  To make the comparison more real between carb-based energy (from the ""other guys"") and healthy-fat-based energy (from IQ Bars), let's chart out what your brain feels like throughout the day on both:For more info and supporting research studies, check out the High-Fat/Low-Net-Carb section of our website. When deciding which compounds to optimize IQ Bars for, we considered only those those with substantial links to positive brain outcomes in scientific literature. Here are the 5 we ultimately selected:What's special about these compounds is they've been shown to provide both overlapping brain benefits (e.g., all are anti-inflammatory in some way), as well as individualized benefits. In aggregate, studies have linked our 5 nutrients to positive outcomes in the following areas:For more info and specific studies, check out the Critical Nutrients section of our website. Numerous studies have found whole foods to have superior nutritional value over their constituent parts, largely because nutrients in whole foods are typically more bioavailable (absorbable and useful) to us.This is why - while many approach the ""brain hacking"" space with pills and tonics - we do so with REAL FOOD that has inputs you can actually pronounce. You won't find bizarre words like ""Xanthan Gum"" and ""Erythritol"" on our packaging because you should be able to understand, trust, and relate to the food you put in your body. IQ Bars come in 3 delicious flavors, each with an uncompromising taste and nutritional profile.Calling all chocolate lovers! With the Almond Cacao IQ Bar, we combined flavonoid-rich cacao, vitamin-E-packed almonds, and tons of other brain-boosting goodness into 45 grams. Feel free to satisfy those choco-cravings guilt-free...and feel smarter for it.  Blueberries and walnuts are not just delicious - they're often cited as leading all other fruits and nuts in brain benefits! So, we figured we'd combine them with a few other nutrient rock stars and see what you guys thought. If you're looking to load up on omega-3's in particular, this bar's got your name all over it.Mmmm...Matcha. The delicious green leaf that has no patience for inflammation and free radicals. And let's not forget hazelnuts, a vitamin-E powerhouse. You simply won't find another bar on the market sporting this dynamic duo. We can't tell you how many people who ""didn't like matcha"" we've converted with this green goodness.      While studying psychology and neuroscience at Harvard, I became fascinated with the human brain. Then, upon entering the workforce, I began experiencing difficulties with my own brain. Mental fatigue and lack of clarity were daily struggles. In search of a quick-and-easy solution, I turned to sugary snacks and caffeinated drinks, yet this just made matters worse - adding sharp energy crashes to my list of cognitive issues.Desperate for stability, I researched and self-tested every lifestyle alteration I could think of. Improved exercise and sleep failed to move the needle. Amphetamines and “nootropic” pills entailed unacceptable risk of dependency and adverse side effects. Eventually, I discovered and experimented with the high-fat/low-net-carb diet promoted by brain nutrition experts like Dr. David Perlmutter and Dr. Mark Hyman. Within weeks of trading bread and pasta for nuts and avocados, I achieved a remarkable rebound in my cognitive performance!Astonished by the impact diet had on my mental acuity, I vowed to share my experience with millions of others struggling to stay sharp. I decided the best way to accomplish this goal was to create and democratize “brain food”. Thus, I set out on a year-long mission to develop all-natural nutrition bars with ingredients shown to support both short-term cognitive function, and long-term brain health.

Our physical books are phone-sized, hand-selected, durable, beautiful, approachable texts that go with you anywhere. They never run out of battery life, they don’t have screens that crack, and they don’t ring, buzz, or vibrate. Mouse Books are all 48 pages.Since starting Mouse Books, the number one comment we receive from people is, ""I think this is really cool, BUT I KNOW SOMEONE WHO WOULD LOVE THIS!"" That feedback became the inspiration for this campaign. We created a collection of three books around the theme of GIVING that helps us take a reflective attitude into the holiday season. We're also designed a custom GIFT CARD to accompany the books!CURATE: Our Mouse editors carefully curate selections of literature, short stories, speeches, poetry, and more, all structured around themes that are topical, challenging, and varied. Basically, we create a great literary playlist.DESIGN: Each text is thoughtfully designed cover-to-cover to make the reading experience easy, fun, and beautiful. BUY: Readers can buy a single themed three-pack and/or a subscription of a monthly book shipment. READ & SHARE: Read Mouse Books on a plane, during your commute, in a coffee shop, at the dentist, at home. When you finish your Mouse Book, give it a home on your bookshelf, or pass it on to a friend, family member, or stranger!REFLECT: Reading without reflection is like eating without digestion (Edmund Burke). Reading Mouse Books is just the first step: We organize online discussions, host weekly podcasts, support local book clubs, and provide thought-provoking questions at the back of the text. BUILD COMMUNITY: The Mouse Book Club brings people together around great works of literature. Join a movement of reading that demands we slow down, look around, reflect on how we are living, and imagine the possibilities of humanity.Mouse Books are meticulously designed. From the text size, to the thickness and color of the paper—every element has been considered, tested, and refined to give you the best and most portable reading experience. A one year subscription will get you one book a month, plus the corresponding audiobooks, podcasts, and surprises! Check out our page on Kickstarter DRIP! You can also buy subs as gifts!!!Our team of editors and designers put a tremendous amount of care into the Mouse Book experience.

Thanks, y’all!!;@ James, @ Jamie - There is a backer in Chicago who has been working on a message board. We've told him that we'll support him, but don't want to control it, as we appreciate the benefits of it be a member-driven resource. James, to your point about diversion, we agree, but at the same time talking out the ideas is important for digesting the material. Done right, a forum could be invaluable.;@ Avery and James - We started emailing backers yesterday. @ James M nailed it - We launched on Friday evening, which is the all-time worst day to launch a kickstarter campaign - especially as it was a holiday. We held off emailing until yesterday. We're attempting to email each previous backer individually, but that is proving to time-intensive as there are 1,000+ backers from last round. I think today I'll blast out to everyone from the last campaign in the afternoon. The goal is certainly to send as few mass emails as possible. But the clock is ticking and we have to kick this campaign into high gear. I'm confident we'll make it, though :) THANKS FOR ALL YOUR EFFORTS TO HELP SPREAD GET THE WORD OUT. Word-of-mouth really makes all the difference.;I don't think there was an e-mail from MBC about this. The e-mail I got was from Kickstarter, from following MBC here. I think the Thanksgiving holiday in the US last week may be why.;I agree that backers of the original campaign should know about this one. I commented there, but an official update by MBC that gets e-mailed to everyone would be better. That would make sure everyone knows about this, and probably encourage a bunch of them to back here, too.;Just found you by ""chance"". As far as I can tell, no email arrived from mousebookclub...backer #41 :) Love the red covers and the theme...;True, both places could work and have their pros and cons. I would like to see questions printed in the books though, so that you don't have to get online to access them. After all, Mouse Books is kind of trying to get us away from our screens and into their books. ;) But you're right that having an online forum for discussing things, where the questions could also be posted as starters, could be way to build the community. That would be a nice option to have, too.;Great idea James. Or maybe post them on their blog so folks could discuss! It would be a nice way to build community.;@Jaime: Hi! :) I happened to be in front of my computer when I got the Kickstarter following e-mail about this project, so I was mostly lucky with being first. Normally, I'd probably be quick to back, but not *that* quick. And AFAIK, you're right about the back-of-the-book questions. I don't think they've been present since one of the earliest copies. It looks like all of the more recent ones have a ""did you just find this book?"" section that encourages passing the books along instead. I guess I can see that -- being a new company and product, they want to get the word out as far and wide as possible. But I agree that it would be nice to have questions in the back again to help guide thinking about the texts. The inside front cover is mostly empty: maybe questions could be printed there, or some of the inside back cover text could be moved to the inside front cover to make room for questions at the back?;Thanks for offering the ten sets of the Giving Collection. It is a great way to spread the news about Mouse Books! I love the cover colors.;Hooray! Good to see James! I would have been number 2, but I was at work! So quick question y'all...on the campaign it talks about there being questions in the back of the mouse books for reflection. I saw that in one mouse book, but there haven't been any in the subsequent books. Any particular reason? I also wanted to mention another use for these great little books-bibliotherapy! They are the perfect size/price to use with clients (another reason I was hoping for questions in the back-so helpful for folks not used to thinking critically about texts)! Love this project and LOVE ME SOME MOUSE BOOKS!;Oh, also, you should probably send an update about this campaign to backers of the original one. Being another one of your projects, it will likely be of interest to backers of the previous one. You might not want to advertise this one there a lot, but I see no harm in making one post to notify everyone about this related campaign.;Thanks, for both the welcome and the info -- always glad to be here! And I'm glad to see that this isn't a different-content subscription, so I'm covered already with my original subscription. I just have to make sure I get things like this that are outside of my subscription content. ;);@ James M. - WE AM SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU ARE BACKER #1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YES - If you are already a subscriber then it is the same books!;Another Mouse Books campaign? I'm in! Backer #1, too. :D;Am I correct that the subscription being offered here is the same as the subscription from the original campaign, in terms of the books they contain? I'm hoping they will be so that I don't need to pay for two subscriptions simultaneously, but I also don't want to miss out on anything (which is why I backed this as soon as I saw it).;Thanks, and good luck with this campaign!;}","$10,000",10,4358.0,"Chicago, IL",36,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mousebooks/mouse-books-holiday-edition,4,"{Frequently Asked Questions

It allows you to play thousands of classic games from Atari, GB, GBA, NES, SNES and many of history’s greatest consoles.       GameShell uses the powerful LINUX operating system and every game published on it will be free, open-source and modifiable. We have included two classic games - Cave Story and DOOM1 in GameShell and there will be more free games included in future.Like many of you, we loved Game Boy, NES and other consoles. We wanted to be able to revisit those classic favorites and refresh the experience in an easy and flexible way and GameShell is designed for that. You can add emulators for all of those classic consoles, install your favorite games, and play it anytime and anywhere.GameShell supports programming languages like preset C, Python, Lua, and LISP. You will be able to modify games and even create new ones as you wish.      More than just a game console, GameShell is design with 5 independent modules and you can use them to learn how to program! We understand the frustration when building a work platform using Arduino, Raspberry Pi and other development boards. Usually it takes hours to set up before you can really start your work but with the easy to assemble GameShell components, that problem is solved.         
                                                          Compare clockwork Pi and Raspberry PiWith the capacity of clockwork Pi, there are many creative ways you can modify and develop, such as creating a DIY wireless speaker, programming a remote to control devices, or making smart toys that interact with Lego blocks.                                   }","Tue, December 19 2017 11:00 AM EST","{Dear GameShell Backers,  ;December is here!

AFAIK some are already confirmed.;@clockwork: Is there a list of already confirmed platforms of RetroArch you know of or have?;@gerraldo
Just because it runs Retroarch does not necessarily mean you can play games of all supported consoles.;@Kaulder & William: On the project page it says: ""It allows you to play thousands of classic games from Atari, GB, GBA, NES, SNES and many of history’s greatest consoles..."". GameShell is also said to run RetroArch (info + list of emulators): https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RetroArch;@Kaulder: I asked them on Facebook and even though it’s not a complete list, I got an answer on NES, SNES and Genesis (Atari as well). They said they are still testing N64. That’s about all I know for now.;What other emulations will the gameshell be able to run. Mostly looking at nes, which i see it has. But what about SNES? I need to get my megaman x in there!;would it be possible in the future to have a transparent rear shell that houses the Lightkey internally?;I am worried that the connecting cable would get snagged and the module would be ripped off the back with the cable.;Note: You can send questions to the Creators directly, so nobody else can read them! Might be helpful to some of us... ;);@William L.T.: I hope it's just a combination of non-native speaker and ultra-caution. But honestly, his questions sound a bit harsh... IMHO all creators here truly believe in their projects - for them it's a labour of love. We are the ones with concerns and the major question is: ""Should I back this project?"".;The major question for Chrysostomos is: ""Should I back this project or wait for the next version?"". (How long will it take? How much will it cost? What would be changed? Etc.);@Gerraldo: I get what Chrystamosis is saying. You start asking questions about a product when the mention of a new future product is brought into the conversation. Like where is my money going? I don’t think he meant any offense, but I’m only assuming.;BTW: Game Boy RULES!!;@Chrysostomos A.: Are you really asking Asian Creators if they are honorable? Really?! Or how do you call someone, who drops support too early, opens projects for products with flaws & they don't believe in?!;BTW: GameBoy is the #1 retro handheld worldwide! The term ""GameBoy"" is often used as a synonym for ""Handheld Gaming Device""... ;);@Chrysostomos Antoniadis;While you're right that there are many handheld consoles they could've emulated (pun intended) with their shape. You have to agree that the GameBoy is by far the most well known.;Regarding subsequent versions with different layouts, considering its modular design I imagine a lot of the parts will be reused and maybe the keypad board will be split in two and placed either side of the screen. Considering how much the modular design is being pushed, I imagine it's likely that the next version(s) will be more evolutionary rather than revolutionary.;@William L.T. Thanks for the correction. I think I have to go back to the english school :P .
@gerraldo @crusy Sorry but I wasn't clear enough. I never meant to offend someone. What I wanted to know is, if there is a specific reason why the went with this shape. I do not judge the choise, but I just want to know. If the reason is the ""retro style"" then OK. But yet again before the Game Boy there was the Game & Watch, and then after a few years was the Game Gear and some other consoles with the horizontal shape. Game Boy is not the only handheald retro console in existance.;And as for the second part of my comment I never said that they should never release this version. I find GameShell great, I like it and I've already backed it up. Is clear that every product producer in this world has always plans for something new. But when they say, ""We'll upgrade the screen when we make a horizontal console in the near future."", what do they acttualy mean? As far as I unterstand ""near future"" is a few months from now. And what will happen with the current version. Will they drop the support? Is there something wrong with this one and the already consider the improvments? And do they really ""believe"" at at this project and if the don't then why should I?;Btw @clockwork this IS a great project, great implementation, I am a big fan of modular devices and I hope you will have the success that you are looking for.;Sorry for the huge comment, I had to explain my self! :);Regarding pledge levels: There is a new and nice picture of what you get with each pledge level on the project page!!!;@Erik: At the moment there are no plans for additional color options (clockwork has already answered this), but you can choose White for front shell and spray-paint it yourself to any color you want (or have it even painted in vivid colors). ;);@Alexander G.: If you just pledge $ 108,-- w/o shipping at Super Early Bird - Special you just receive the Lego Shell! Cause it needs $ 113,-- to get it on top of the normal one.
BTW: Player Super Early Bird (Special) pledge level(s) have been added later and cost exactly the same as Super Early Bird - Special with ($ 113,--) or w/o additional normal back shell ($ 108,--). And T-Shirt is missing. ;);@Alexander: Like what @Mick said, they were added after the Super Specials were sold out for the earliest adopters. Any currently available were either added or backers who switched their pledge to a different package.;@Alexander G.;Yes, but the Player variant was only added after the original was no longer available.;At no point were they both available to back.;@clockwork @Mick McCarthy;They are both super early bird though, and both ""Special"" :);The second one just has the added ""Player"" level, less rewards and costs more. That's why I'm wondering. I got the other level anyway.;Hi clockwork team just wanted to ask if you might consider adding a other front shell colour like green or even a clear front shell? Don't know if this would be hard to accomplish. Well thanks for your hard work can't wait to get my hands on my Gameshell.;@Alexander G. @Mick McCarthy, Yes, and thanks Mick for the answer.;Regarding the price difference between Super Early Bird (Special) & Player Super Early Bird (Special).;@Alexander G.;I imagine that's because early backers tend to be rewarded more for their early support.;@clockwork I would love to have a video of the screen because yeah, it looks really very blue :-s And could you confirm that with my pledge of Super Early Bird - Special (at 99$) which one I added 14$, I will have the lightkey module ?Thanks to you :-);Also @clockwork could you make a video of the screen where you can actually see the colors it produces? All the photos and videos make the colors look very blue and washed out :(;@clockwork:;Can you tell me what I'm missing here:;- Super Early Bird Special = 99$ + 9$ for the lightkey module = 108$
- Player Super Early Bird - Special = 113$;The first one contains a T-Shirt, the second one doesn't. Why is the Player Super Early Bird - Special more expensive?;When will the next stretch goal be announced?;@nt1, as 18bit RGB output is the hardware limitation.;@nt1, The GameShell only support up to RGB 18-bit display output.;@M, We'll release schematic circuit diagram and software system after delivery.;@Connor Angelo Victorio, Hi Connor, only Super early bird and Super early bird - special includes T-shirt.;@Nick Wepfer, you need to pledge 123 USD in total, you will get a new Lego rear shell, and a Lightkey. $123= $99 (super early bird- special) + $5 (Lego rear shell) + $9( Lightkey) + $10 (Shipping cost);Next Stretch Goal:;No HDMI Out = We Riot!!;— Just kidding, but it’s my main want right now ;);@William L.T.: ""It is already a vertical setup..."" Oh boy, you are SO right! Silly me, haven't even noticed... :)));@Gerraldo: Exactly. Why release anything? If they keep quiet with possible future releases, you wouldn’t even be thinking about it.;If everyone waits for the next iteration, we’ll all always be waiting. As it is, after backing some pledges, they have been the most transparent company/team in responding to backers and I thank them for it.;@Chrysomosis A: It is already a vertical setup. I believe you mean horizontal. I for one love the classic look.;Are the open hardware and open source software available already? I'd really like to have a look at the board schematics and maybe run a qemu or similar with the software stack.;@Chrysostomos A.: Maybe because there are people - like me - who LOVE the classic GameBoy style!? And a vertical shape could be, but is not ""automatically"", more comfortable and flexible.
Regarding the plans for an improved version... Why release anything? There are always plans for the next generation(s), but you have to start somewhere, don't you? ;);I don't get it. ""Outdated""? Well, it's even _called_ ""retro"" :-) It's clearly a Game Boy Classic reminiscence, and yes, that brings certain limitations. A vertical design and no native L/R buttons, for example. A limited screen is another one, you just don't need a better one for _this_ concept (though it already is better than the original one). And as there will be different versions in the future: If this is a deal breaker, just wait for those ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Long story short: Good work, @clockwork, I do love it! I hope the 3rd stretch goal will focus on the current concept :-);Connor A.V.: Yes, switch to Super Early Bird - Special and raise the pledge amount to $ 113,-- ($ 99,-- + $ 9,-- + $ 5,--), shipping will be added for your country. (You'll have everything + T-Shirt!) ;);@Nick Wepfer: Super Early Bird is $ 89,-- + Lightkey $ 9,-- + Lego shell option $ 5,-- = $ 103,-- + shipping. (Your pledge amount should be raised to $ 103,-- and shipping will be added automatically for your country)
Note: You'll have just the Lego back shell. If you want the normal back shell plus the Lego one, you need to switch to a special pledge.;Why didn't you chose a vertical form for this project? Imo the ""classic game boy style"" is outdated where the vertical shape is more comfortable and more flexible for extra additions. Moreover, if you already have plans for a second improved version, why then releasing the current one and why should I support it. Don't take me wrong, I am more than happy to support you (and I already have). I am just wondering!;Still waiting for the 3rd stretch goal.;My question was not about the size of the display neither it's resolution, but about its colours depth, in the specs it's mentioned 18bits that's 262144 colours all inclusive no transparency, so in 2018, why not using a 16Billions colours display (24 bits = 8 Red, 8 Green, 8 Blue) and even 8 more so it's aligned on 32 bits and there is 8 bits (255 layers) of transparency or Z coordinate for an eventual super smooth 3D engine?
Thanks for your explanations about the pledge options.;I have the player super early bird - special, is there a way to get a t-shirt still?;i have a super early bird pledged at 119$, can you inform me if this is accurate to get all add ons that have been earned through stretch goals? let me know and look forward to this gaming beast!;""...when we make a horizontal console in the near future.""
That sounds promising! ;);@nt1, The 2.7"" screen that we used for the GameShell is a choice of experienced screen manufacturer and modular design of this handheld game console. We'll upgrade the screen when we make a horizontal console in the near future. As for the pledge of yours is Super early bird special, add $14 USD to get a new Lego back case and a Lightkey, and you will get the standard back case too. If you add $9, you will get a Lightkey, and you only get one back case (Lego back case or standard one).;@Hill Cheung, The installation method of the ROM will be released on our official website (www.clockworkpi.com) as well as in the manual.;The campaign pledge and Add-On structure seems to be so unclear and confusing (almost all the posts of this comment section are related to how much should I add to get the keys and Lego backcase... personally I still do not even get is I will get the Lego and the standard backcase... I believe it makes sense to have both).;Anyway, nobody seems interested in my remark regarding the colour and graphical effect available with the current display (and its provided specifications)... any news?;I grab some roms and load them into the SD card, Gameshell will be able to run, or I need to do some more installation/setting/etc?;Maybe this is a stupid question, coz I am not a tech guy :'(

With digital purification from UVC light, your water and bottle is purified at the touch of a button.
 
   We all want to drink more water and use less plastic, but existing reusable bottles do not make it easy. We surveyed 200+ people and found these common issues: The results are appalling with more than a million bottles every minute being added to landfills around the world. That’s over 480 billion annually and climbing - enough plastic to wrap around the earth’s equator more than twice. Every. Year.That’s a statistic you don’t want to be a part of. Bottom line is that the existing reusable bottles are failing to curb the use of plastic bottles.

That’s why we started QUARTZ with a simple idea: Pure water from a self-cleaning bottle.The QUARTZ Bottle is designed to solve the biggest consumer pain points so there are no more excuses to reach for that one-use plastic bottle.
  
      
      Whether you’re on the trail, at the gym, or in the office, you know that staying hydrated helps you feel and perform your best. So don’t think twice about whether you want to grab a refill. Explore new trails and new countries with confidence. Even when you’re not sure about your water source, you can count on QUARTZ to eliminate bacterial and viral contaminants.When your body needs water the most, make sure it’s getting the best. The inside of your water bottle should be a whole lot cleaner than the inside of your gym bag.Clean water isn’t a privilege, it’s a right. The QUARTZ Bottle gives you the power to take pure water with you everywhere you go, sanitizing enough water for your whole family with a single charge.QUARTZ combines the power of the sun with the advances of the digital age. The UVC LED chips in QUARTZ are smaller, more energy efficient, less toxic (mercury free), and more economical compared to traditional Mercury based UV technology.       
    663 million people in the world live without safe drinking water. We believe technology and design has the ability to transform lives. That is why we are continually exploring innovative ways of working with nonprofit organizations to bring our core technology to the millions in need of access to clean water.

Only recommendation would be to perhaps place the engraving on the side of the bottle rather than the bottom. Best of luck with another decent increase in backers before the end date!;@Antonio - one campaign I followed used Wing.eu as European shipping fulfillment;@Antonio - Thank you.. SGs are really not that important to me. Just make sure that the Quartz is PERFECT!! Also, I always keep a look out for copycats of any campaign. I never like people who plagiarize other people's ideas and con unsuspecting backers.;@Antonio As best I can recall, I've never claimed that you or anyone on your team has been ungrateful towards the backers of this project. If any message I wrote implied that, or came across as attacking you and the team, then I do apologize for that. I, like many others, am simply upset by the numbers we see. Yes, having more backers means a higher cost to manufacture and ship all those bottles. I also wasn't aware that you had extended the early bird discount. Not being aware of all the numbers, some of the backers demands, myself obviously included, may seem impossible to execute.;However, like Paul and James have said, being funded so strongly must produce some funds for stretch goals. The fact that you've set stretch goals at all means that you do have some sort of financial plan to execute them, but it seems rather unobtainable with such lofty goals set. It almost feels like a false sense of reward, where we have the promise of things we want but no way to get them.;If you can't give out the sleeve for free as a stretch goal, then my recommendation still remains to make the improved SG design as the final shipping unit to people who buy the sleeve, and to remove it as a SG. Then move the remaining two SG’S up to $1.2M and $1.5M respectively. The engraving is a nice touch which I can't imagine costs too much (though I still think the placement is odd), and I think raising $1.5M is more than enough to make you guys reconsider your plans and timeline for manufacturing the larger bottle.;Honestly, James and Paul probably put into words best what all of us want, and I thank you for promising to bring it up with the team. Please make sure they see all the comments and understand our perspectives, and hopefully a middle ground can be achieved. :);Thank you citiboi. From my previous comment, I'll talk it over with the team and let you know what we can do.;Lets look out tomorrow for another copy-cat!;@Antonio - Firstly, it is the Creator's prerogative whether to award SGs to show their gratitude to their backers when a funding milestone is reached. That being said, SGs are rewards given free of charge or offered at a discounted price to the backers and should benefit to most (if not all) backers. In this regard, although I am not taking sides here as my pledge entitles me to one sleeve, I have to agree with Antonio that it is a little unfair if your backers are expected to pledge more money just to be entitled to the SG. It would have been fine if you didn't call it a SG but by calling it a SG, it is not surprising that some of your backers feel aggrieved.;Secondly, this campaign has been so successful that if you are really sincere about showing your gratitude through SG at this late stage, you should probably not announce SGs which seem quite unattainable. 1.5 mil? 2.0 mil? Really?;As for your comment that ""it's not like that by some magic some extra money will be left out after we deliver our bottle"", you do realize that even if you had a modest profit margin of only 10%, 10% of $30,000 and 10% of $1,000,000 are miles apart. Granted the percentage may be the same but the amount is totally different. This 10% calculation does not even take into account the increase in prices with different perks and the unexpected savings which you will be able to enjoy from your negotiate with the manufacturers due to the significant increase in orders. In terms of funds, you definitely have much more excess than you originally anticipated.;In conclusion, as backers we cannot demand that you ""reward"" us through freebies as SGs but please do not tell your backers that having achieved more than 3,000% of your funding target, you cannot afford to offer SGs.;@Antonio. No problem! Thank you to inform me. I'll be waiting for the answers tomorrow. Good night !;@paul no problem. I'm not sure that I follow your math though. Funding has increased 36x but profit is still the same (given that backers pledge correct amounts and not give us obscene amounts of money for some reason :D). Reaching $2mil wouldn't change that. It would only make us reconsider some plans to be able to deliver larger bottle 3-4 months earlier than planned.;Thank you for your elaborate comments Paul and James, I get your points. I'll discuss it with the team and get back to you.;@Jacynthe apologies for that. I'll get back to you personally tomorrow morning about your questions as I'm ""digital"" guy and want to give you correct answers.;In a neutral voice, I would like to say that I understand somewhat that by deciding to extend the Early Bird packages, the overall profitability will drop as should be obvious by the fact that the Early Bird is less expensive than the identical Kickstarter Special.;All things considered, however, after raising over 3600% of the predefined goal, surely there will have been a decent sum of money left over that can be split up accordingly. As Paul said, the company is clearly not a non-profit and should have (by which I mean, presumably has) done the math beforehand. It'd be silly to extend a pledge that leaves you with no financial cushion at all.
Anyhow, my point there is that the leftover sums, after necessarily and reasonably sustaining the company, should go right back into the product--it is the product we are paying for, after all. Unfortunately (in terms of the human aspect), I don't think anyone (though I could be wrong) was so generous as to have backed the project to line the pockets of those working for the company. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the company itself is like a nonentity; many of us predictably would've backed anyone who offered the same quality of item, simply because it's an item that people see as being worth their money because of the perks it offers. Thus, it seems only right that the money goes where the people who spent it wanted it to go, which is into the product.
That said, I'm not against money going into the company--you have to make some profit and keep your business afloat. I'm simply saying that once you hit a mark that is 3600% above your asking price and the only upgrade to the product thus far has been the addition of a color that was always shown on the campaign page in the first place, it seems as though almost none of the money is being placed back into the product.;@Antonio
Thanks for responding.;Firstly yes, I have read all your comments about previous decisions. I fully understand that offering a free sleeve or making changes to the bottle design is not feasible. You may note that I have never asked for these things.;In answer to your question, it’s basic mathematics. Obviously you are not running a non-profit business here, so with currently 36x your funding you are likely to make (more or less) 36x your original profit. That means there will be somewhat more available to fund a SG.;Other campaigns manage to give SG benefits at 2x, 5x or 10x funding. Are you really claiming that at 36x funding you cannot afford any SG unless people spend even more money?;Further, they offer the SG benefits to all backers.;And to claim you have not asked for more money for backers to receive stretch goal benefits is simply not true.;In any case, the 3 main points I and others have made have still not been addressed.
Let me write them again, and explain them this time in order to make this unambiguous:;1. The only realistically achievable SG is not available to all backers.
Explanation: this is a fact, not an opinion. So by definition, it’s unfair.;2. You are asking backers to pledge more money for an additional product before they can benefit from the SG.
Explanation: backers cannot benefit from the SG unless they also buy a sleeve. The sleeve is not the product we backed. The bottle is the product we backed. The sleeve is an additional product you are asking us to buy in order to benefit from the SG.;3. Having already received pledges for over 36x your goal, you are still not offering any extra benefit to backers, unless you receive yet another 4x your initial goal.
Explanation: see my response to your question.;People think this is a great product, it’s why it’s so popular. Can you not simply admit that you made some bad decisions regarding the stretch goals, and adjust them accordingly?;@Antonio @Justin I know you guys must be really busy, but I would like an answer to my questions please. So I'll ask for a third time :;For Canada shipping, is there any fees or taxes to be expected or is it included in the shipping price ?
Does Li-Po battery have a 3 years shelf life as mentioned pretty much everywhere on the internet ?;@paul @steve why makes you think that 1x or 36x makes a difference in having ""deluge of money"", extra funding that is to produce additions? That number only shows how the product has been received, how successful it is i.e. hit or miss. It's not like that by some magic some extra money will be left out after we deliver our bottle. If' you've read my comments about the extension of Early Bird reward and decision with going with that one due to receiving so many positive feedback and people asking to extend the ""Early Bird"" instead of running Kickstarter Special, you'd understand that while we'd like to offer a free sleeve to everyone, it's simply not feasible to do.;Correct me if I'm wrong, but we've asked you to help out to spread the word about Quartz, to make the reach even bigger than we can do it on our own, not to ""give us more money(?)"".;What makes you think that we are not grateful? Because we've put out realistic goals that we can deliver? Sure, they might not seem much to you, but to us they do and again, we are not asking more money for them in a sense of upping your pledge, we are asking to spread the word.;Thank you for your support and I apologize in advance if I've sounded harsh.;+1 @Paul Excellently said.;@Antonio
Many have pointed out these specific points to which you have not responded:;1. The only realistically achievable SG is not available to all backers.
2. You are asking backers to pledge more money for an additional product before they can benefit from the SG.
3. Having already received pledges for over 36x your goal, you are still not offering any extra benefit to backers, unless you receive yet another 4x your initial goal.;The upshot of the above is that you appear to be (a) avoiding addressing these legitimate points, and (b) greedy.;Seriously - you guys were aiming for 30k and already have almost 1.1 million with 6 days still to go. You were asking for help and have received a deluge of money - more than you could have ever dreamed for.;Purely hypothetical, but if it were me in such a situation I’d be bending over backwards to show my absolute gratitude to each and every backer for their part in turning what was a reasonably realistic target into an absolute screaming success.;Instead we see excuses and attempts to justify what many of your backers obviously feel is extremely unfair and who have clearly explained their reasons why.;+1 @Leon I made a comment a day or two ago suggesting exactly that: sleeve free as the $1M stretch, engraving at $1.2M, and bigger bottle at $1.5M. Even though that $1.5M is unlikely to be hit, at least we get a free sleeve and the next stretch goal is achievable.;+1@Steven as you guys have reiterated the main product is the bottle, when I was doing the survey I clearly though that a free upgrade meant that all backers of the bottle would get a free sleeve. I didn't expect that it was for the minority who bought the sleeve, otherwise I would never have voted for the ""sleeve upgrade"". Stretch goals are to reward loyal backers, not fleece them by having super unrealistic stretch goals especially with just 7 days remaining , and to have stretch goals where it only benefits a minority of backers. Just let us have the sleeve free as a 1M stretch goal. That seems fair, and would be a great stretch goal. The engraving can be shifted to 1.2million, and larger bottle at 1.5million.;I love the concept of your product guys, and I want to believe you're trying your best. But no one here is saying your stretch goals are reasonable except you guys. You set far too ambitious goals given the remaining funding time, and it feels very unrewarding to us, the backers, to have those stretch goals so clearly unobtainable. You held a vote, and you know what we want. You just have to actually give it to us. And also, really, please just give us the sleeves for free as a $1M stretch goal. The survey made it sound like we'd get them for free and I imagine that's what a lot of backers interpreted it as.;Let's be realistic: the goals need to be reduced. There isn't enough time to raise $1.5M, let alone $2M. I understand that the larger bottle would present a challenge to produce, but you guys set the ship date for several months after the regular bottles ship. It's clear you accommodated for the manufacturing challenge the larger bottle would produce. So for us to fund your product several hundred times over, just to be told that we need to double what we've already raised, and do so in a week, is basically saying: ""We know there's demand for a larger bottle, but it would be a huge challenge to make so we're going to try to avoid having to do it"".;@Antonio You say something incredible would have to happen to make a larger bottle, hence the high stretch goal. Basically you made the goal unobtainable because you don't believe you guys can make it a reality; at least, that's what I interpreted from your message. If that's the case, why even present it as an option? The stretch goals are meant to be a way of rewarding us, the backers, and giving us things we want for funding your products. To hit $1M, far more than you originally asked for, and then to be told that we have to raise an absurd amount of money in a tight time frame to earn a sleeve we still have to pay extra for, an engraving no one will see, and a larger bottle which it doesn't seem like you're prepared to manufacture, seems quite unfair.;Thank you for your comment Jennifer. I hope you'll allow me to disagree and elaborate further.;You guys (backers) have been giving us suggestion on how we can improve further, which type of accessories you'd like to see and so many more for which we are eternally grateful as we believe in criticism, insight and we'll do everything we can to make a better product, so please keep them coming!;In some of our previous comments we've mentioned that we weren't thinking of having stretch goals and here's why - a lot of work has been put in to Quartz and when the time came where we thought we are ready to finish the product with your help, we constructed a precise timeline to make it happen without delaying or postponing any part of the process. It's constructed so tight with accounted buffer for ""unpredictable"" things (which we've outlined and discussed in great detail - talking about the retail ready product and commerce part as both Justin, myself and members of the team have a vast experience in both) because of which we were/are very cautious with having additions to the timeline. Both sleeve upgrade and engraving were accounted for in this ""buffer"" which is why they were one of the choices in the survey. Coming back to your point of ""not listening to you guys"" - these new stretch goals were the result of a survey which we've asked you to vote on.;Where we are now is nothing short of a miracle. While we believe in the product we've created, we couldn't dream of the positive feedback and warm welcome we've received. While both bigger and smaller bottles are both viable options and it's something we'll do in the near future we felt that something extraordinary would have to happen to put us on additional fixed timeline as we'd be double the number of SKU's to produce, hence the $2mil mark.;I hope you won't mind me being transparent about the situation and I(we) thank you for your support as none of this would have happened without it.;@jorge thank you for that. I am waiting on a quote from a couple of 3PL's and I'll reach out happyshops soon.;+1@Jennifer Brownell: I totally agree.;I'm so disappointed with your stretch goals. Your product has done so well and your backers haven't asked for them yet. You should do the sleeve automatically as a thank you for getting $1m and making a larger bottle $1.2, maybe. Or you could've released stretch goals two or three weeks ago. With the engraving it doesn't sound like you were listening to your backers and with waiting this long and making your stretch goals so high it looks like you are extremely greedy and you have no humility or gratitude toward your backers.;2 million stretch goal launched near very end for best stretch goal of them all the 1st can be easily got cheap in the market, the 2nd I doubt that’s what people who selected it thought they me get but the 3rd goal that’s an actual benefit;Also, as @Xander Chew pointed out no one will notice the engraving. Perhaps moving it to the base of the bottle, so that it wraps around the bottle, would be a better spot. Personally, if I'm getting an engraving like that, I'd want it shown off.;@Antonio No one is debating that this is a useful product, and absolutely where your focus should be. However, if you're going to go through the trouble of designing and setting rewards for strecteh goals, they should be obtainable and useful. The sleeve getting a detachable clip is how it should've been designed in the first place. The engraving is a great example of a stretch goal, but it's $1.5M requirement is somewhat out there, let alone the $2M requirement for the larger bottle.;@Antonio. The Gloomhaven boardgame campaign used Happyshops www.happyshops.com as their European fulfillment center.;Hi guys,;I understand that to some of you new stretch goals are not appoling enough. Like Justin said in his comments, our goal first and foremost is to deliver what we've promised and more importantly when we've promised and that's a great bottle in my humble opinion that solves the biggest pain points that consumers have with existing bottles which are bottle contamination, odor caused by germs and mold, and lack of on-the-go access to safe drinking water.;We truly thank you for your suggestions and comments we've received here, via DM or email as they made us think and gave us options on wide variety of accessories and features. Keep them coming!;Wanted to do a quick updated on EU friendly shipping - I've lined up a lot of meetings with potential 3PL services in the next couple of days, however I still need help from EU customers.;If you know which solution some of the campaigns were using, please let me know. If you've received a custom tracking mail then there could be a logo of a company there.;Also, info if you've received package with e.g. fedex or usps is also important.;Thank you!;I was also disappointed of how the SG's were set up. You should be more considerate with your backers.;seriously... you guys are really too much.
for a 30k goal with 1m pledge on hand and yet still asking for more unrealistic stretch goal;anyway please update on the safety mechanism feature in the campaign page;The stretch goals are a non-sense. Other campaigns have more ralistic ones... And doesn't mean having to pay extra money. Improving an extra add-on? The product is the bottle... Only one week left and trying to double the amount of money?
Also I am worried with the EU issue;I thought that the black friday deal wasn't that appealing, but maybe that's because i was only looking to buy one bottle. But these stretch goals are just dreadful. Goals that are aimed not at the product, this neglecting majority of the backers (sleeves when the main product is the bottle), stretch goals that are overly ambitious (>1.2mil when the initial funding aim was only 30k), and stretch goals that just want more money.;Poor stretch goals, there's no rewarding the backers here. Just asking us for more money.;Where will be these bottles made? I really hope it's in the US, because I am trying to avoid things made in China.;$1.5M for a SG with absolutely no functionality or purpose for which no one will notice, is quite the stretch..;Totally agree with you guys, SG should have been at $1M.
Free sleeve $1M
Larger bottle $1.2M
Engraved bottle shouldn't be a SG, maybe an extra-pay....;And regarding my comment on the carabineer, I do realize the bottle is already designed and a sleeve is the best that can be done. The sleeve does also encapsulate most of the bottle, so really the likelihood of it falling out should be quite low, even with it bouncing around on a bag. Still, a loop on the bottle itself is a future design to keep in mind, perhaps. I also like the idea from the survey of incorporating a physical filter. I imagine if that was one of the suggestions on the survey, rather than just something could think of to put as other, it would've got more attention.;Also, to clarify my second most recent comment, I meant that a free sleeve at $1.2M would be awesome, but an upgrade to the sleeve that you still have to pay extra for, and frankly, an upgrade that should've been the way it was designed to start with, isn't exactly a great stretch goal.;So here's what I think: the $1.2M stretch goal should be a free sleeve for all backers, with the better loop, OR the sleeve remains something we pay extra for, though with the upgraded loop standard and not attached to a stretch goal. The engraving should then move to $1.2/$1.25M and the larger bottle to $1.5M.;Exactly as Steven Sala says - surely we shouldn't have to pay more to buy an extra product to benefit from a stretch goal?;Isn't the whole point of a stretch goal to thank and deliver something extra to everyone who backed the product?;The idea that you're following the survey results ignores the fact that some of the survey options were exclusively for sleeve buyers, when the actual product we're backing is the bottle!;I've pledged for 2 bottles. I'm sure many backers have pledged to buy even more than this, sleeve-free. Please be fairer to the many non-sleeve buyers who are also funding your business.;@teresa Excellent point. And I mean, aside from the fact that we aren't getting the sleeve for free, having the sleeve come with a detachable loop after $1.2M isn't a very good reward. Frankly I think it should've been designed that way from the beginning. A free sleeve for all backers at $1.2M is awesome, but a sleeve with a detachable loop for people that pay the extra $12? Like, come on, why wasn't it already like that? Also, and maybe this is just me, but I'd much rather have a carabineer directly attached to the bottle when it's bouncing around. Makes me feel more confident I won't lose it when it's on my bad and I'm hiking around with it bouncing everywhere.;+1 @Steven Sala. And not only about the sleeves, because even f we did hit the 2M SG to choose the bigger bottle, we would still have to pay extra. An SG should be something we get for free because the funding is higher than initially needed and the backers are rewarded for their support. So disappointing the SGs in this campaign.;@Steven Sala yup i thought exactly as well......;Also, I can’t have been the only one that thought “a free upgrade to the sleeve” meant getting the sleeve for free with the bottle, not “buy the sleeve and we’ll give you a better one for no extra cost on top of the $12 you already paid”.;The stretch goals seems quite unrealistic. $1.2M, $1.5M and $2M??? Seriously???;Yeah, the $2M stretch goal is quite ambitious and most likely unobtainable in such a short time frame. I'm glad the closest stretch goals are the ones most voted on, but $1.5M is already quite ambitious, let alone $2M. I think they should be readjusted.;Have to agree with some recent comments. 1m should have been the next SG.. Heck of an accomplishment from the 30k starting goal.;Two things: I would really like this product to become EU friendly (no, not only CE approved, I am referring to being sent from within the EU so we have don't pay importe taxes that will easily add 20% plus to the final value); and second, can we have on the campaign site more details about the sleeves? Right now their is no concrete information about them. I thing they look nice but what are their characteristics. It would be nice to know more since they are a paid add-on. Thanks a lot!;How come we reached an SG at 1.000.000 and we did a survey to choose which but now the SG is at 1.200.000? It´s disappointing to see the very long gaps between SGs. The big bottle seems so far away when it was so close ; (;Any chance I could trade my 2 CES tickets for bottle sleeves instead?;Is the sleeve only available in one colour?

Over 65 million people have been forced from their homes by war and violence. These innocent people are stuck in indefinite limbo, without the freedom to work, play and live free. It’s a miserable existence that crushes aspiration and traps talent. But what if one small object had the power to give back opportunity to those who have lost it? That is the objective of The Pin Project: to help displaced persons, returnees and refugees achieve long-term self-reliance through meaningful work. By buying or gifting a Pin made by a refugee, displaced person or returnee, you will help create employment and income for a displaced generation to craft their own futures.  We are partners from around the world. Under Pricing we outline the approximate conversation rates for each reward you purchase.  The Pin measures 0.95 inches wide x 1.4 inches long (3.5 cm x 2.4 cm). The Pin weighs between 5.5 and 6 grams. This is how the Pin will be packaged: Wearing the Pin Iconic, fashion-forward and universal, the Pin can be worn anywhere, on anything, by anyone. It’s a badge of honor, signifying our shared commitment to meeting one of the greatest challenges of our time. The Pin is designed by the award-winning jewelry designer Jenny Bird. The kite is a symbol of hope and aspiration. It represents the power of humanity’s ability to rise above challenges, no matter how great. As the season of giving and goodwill approaches, make a difference with your gifts this holiday season. After backing the campaign, we’ll send you a virtual card previewing the Pin and showing how it will make a difference, which you can then forward to the recipient(s) of your choosing.   For an extra special gift or keepsake, choose our elegant 18-Karat Solid Gold Pin. You can also choose a collection of all three Pins.  *These are approximate conversions as of November 15th, 2017.  The sheer scale of the refugee crisis is daunting. People want to help, but often don’t know where to start. The Pin Project gives anyone a chance to do something positive and simple to help displaced persons, returnees and refugees today.The Pin Project is also fundamentally different from donating to charity: you give refugees, displaced persons or returnees the chance to take control of their own futures through income-earning opportunities.By buying a Pin you are not only providing makers with direct wages, you are also funding training and the purchase of tools and equipment required to generate long-term employment opportunities where they are desperately needed. The UN Refugee Agency believes that 1 in 3 viable jobs for refugees is in craft production. Craft production is a long-term driver of economic growth in developing economies. The skills that crafts training provides are lifelong, suitable for people of all genders, easily transferable from generation to generation, and have been found to have higher levels of job satisfaction than many other jobs available to displaced people. Refugees should not be viewed as passive victims. By providing meaningful work we can unlock their potential, develop new skills, and help them forge a pathway to autonomy. A prevailing phenomenon in all refugee camps is utter boredom. It isn’t that most refugees don’t want to work, it is that working is very rarely an option available for them. The Pin Project will reignite a sense of daily purpose and help restore structure and dignity to shattered lives. The Pin has been designed so that it can be made by displaced persons around the world. While elegant, the design is also simple and replicable. The materials to make the Pin can also be sourced locally.We have developed a straightforward ‘How To’ guide outlining step by step instructions to creating the Pin, making it possible to scale production to almost anywhere in a relatively short amount of time.  Our initial focus is on countries with the world’s largest refugee, internally displaced and returnee populations. For the first 30,000 Pins, we will partner with existing workshops in Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon, Afghanistan and Burkina Faso. If the Kickstarter Campaign reaches well beyond our target, we will be able to expand globally to support other affected refugee populations, including South Sudanese refugees in Uganda, Somali refugees in Kenya, and Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh (see the map above and refer to our stretch goals below for more information).Our impact will grow rapidly as we raise more money because our production partners will be training a greater proportion of new artisans. The average artisan will make 3 pins per day, but as we produce more, we will employ more artisans who will only be able to produce 1-2 Pins per day. Employment for a single refugee for can benefit up to 10 people. If we raise $750,000 or roughly 30,000 pins sold, we will be able to expand production to Myanmar, Uganda, Kenya and Bangladesh. These are our projected financials for the campaign, which may fluctuate based on the number of pins sold.  The production process is simple and will be similar from workshop to workshop, country to country. Turquoise Mountain, our technical partner, will provide technical assistance to new producers, leveraging their extensive experience doing so.  The Pin Project is an initiative being launched by a coalition of like-minded social enterprises working with refugees: Far + Wide Collective, ISHKAR, Global Goods Partners and Turquoise Mountain.   We hope to add other production partners to the campaign as we reach our stretch goals.      }","Wed, December 20 2017 11:00 AM EST","{In a world of instant gratification, the gift of work, livelihoods and a sense of self-worth for those who have lost hope is a very special one.;Not long ago...

This is what Kickstarting should be and I proud of be a backer for this project. How knows maybe when the time is right, it might be a place to see changes. Keep up the passion.;Warm regards,
Ke Jing GOH;Thank you Jaron for for your lovely message:);Dear Ignacio,;Thank you for your kid comments we truly appreciate it!;Warm regards,;Hedvig;Dear Aka13,;Of course everyone is entitled to their opinion, but they also have to respect other people’s commitment and work. I have been a development person all my life and so has all the other partners. We have spent our entire careers working on poverty reduction here and abroad. Everything raised in this campaign with exception of unavailable costs such a shipping, Paypal and Kickstarter fees, necessary marketing to get the campaign noticed and some project support goes directly back. Everybody is working for free and in their spare time to try to solve a big problem in a new way. I apologize being this direct but I can see you have a habit of pledging $1 to projects and criticizing them in very harsh ways. It is unkind considering all the incredible work people have put into getting a campaign of the ground.;Warm regards,;Hedvig;Dear Hedvig,;I did study the project carefully and I do not make comments like I made lightly or carelessly. I love supporting projects that I believe truly help people in need. But I could not make myself support this project which to me feels insincere. While I understand that there will be no profit made for companies involved, I still do not feel like this is truly an effort to help refugees or contribute on par with others, as opposed to a good marketing campaign to make a better name for oneself. I hope you also understand that everyone can have an opinion, based on their perception of the events.;All the best,
Aka13;This is a truly inspiring project, everyone involved should feel so proud. I also love what the pin represents and it looks amazing, I can't wait to receive it :);Dear Aka13,;Thank you for your message. The cost of the pin we directly buy from the refugees, displaced persons or returnees goes directly back (that is the 25%) and so the proceeds which is 48%. A total of 73% goes directly back. No one is making any money on this - on the contrary - this has only been possible because so many people including Jenny Bird has given there time. It a huge effort that our board coalition and incredibly proud off. You can see the entire breakdown on the KS page where you pledged you $1.;The Pin Project is to support current workshops with resources to build their capacity to expand their production for new products beyond the pin and have greater exposure in the global marketplace. This will contribute to a more sustainable livelihood enterprise for refugees, displaced people and retunes all over the world.;I hope this makes it more clear and that you will be kind enough to consider taking down your comment.;Warmest,;Hedvig;In all honesty though, I expected more from Jenny Bird. Common, only 25% of the price will actually go to refugees? So from 100,000 you raise, only 1/4 or $25,000 will go to people in struggle. And other 25% will be spend on some sort of bs like campaign management and advertisement? Yes, you talk about long term education... but you know all well, that this is just temporary. The minute people stop ordering pins refugees will go back to nothing. I've been to refugee camps and I can tell what sort of delusional hope campaigns like this give them. It would be nice to see some sort of commitment, or some skin in the game from Jenny Bird as well. So far I cannot possibly see how this will improve anyone's life.;The pins look stylish, with a wonderful message behind them. Can't wait to wear them and gift them to loved ones. All the best to the social enterprises making this happen!;}","$29,504",34,69709.0,"Toronto, Canada",121,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1541394380/the-pin-project,15,"{Frequently Asked Questions

SURREAL.We live in a time where no compromises need to be made, and we have all the tools as artists to make it happen ourselves. Using platforms like Kickstarter to gain the support of our people to make it possible and keep making it possible. sure it might be compelling to let someone bigger and wiser steer the ship, but at what price?None of the labels I met with truly believed I’ll be able to cross over from shooting covers to producing original music.. and more than that they didn’t think any of you would care. well turns out that not accepting their offer was the best decision I ever made, cause you guys DID care, and YOU made it BLOW UP!For years I was looking for the right label deal, till it dawned on me - I already have the best label an artist can ask for - YOU!Out of Chaos is the first song of the yet to be present album - it marks the beginning of a new understanding and a whole new approach to writing, free of expectations or industry guidelines of what it should or should not be and the first step in this yet to be written chapter in the MEYTAL saga.I’ve been fortunate to gather a group of some of the most talented people I’ve ever met, each with his own little quarks that make them special in their own amazing way. and not only that, they also happen to be some of the sweetest people this world had ever seen - I would gladly carry them all in my pocket if they’d fit, but that’s ok, cause they probably won’t let me.If you want to REALLY know someone, go on tour with them. Just be in eachothers face 24/7 in a small confined space for a couple weeks, that should do it. first I’ll say, my tour experience would not give me the best rating as a human. for one I was sick AF roughly 98% of the time, and the amounts of anxiety I had about playing live after years of playing alone in my studio shooting videos for you guys, had me INCREDIBLY finicky about my drum set up (I think my drum tech hates me, as well he should).But regardless, I’m super grateful to have had this opportunity and I can now honestly say my band consists of some of THE best people I’ve ever met. period. with that said, sometimes people just don’t mash. It’s not anyone's fault, it's just how it is. and by the end of the tour it was clear that Eric and I were going our separate ways. No hard feelings at all, I’m grateful for the time we had together and wish him nothing but the best!At the end of a long-ass and most frustrating singer search, I found that the right person was there all along! the one person who was most involved in this project, who wrote the songs with me and produced Alchemy, Sahaj Ticotin. Some of you know him as the lead singer of RA which got worldwide recognition and sold over 500K copies in the US alone - haven’t yet met a person with his vocal chops and beaming personality. And that statement IS incredibly ACCURATE (minus the part about his beaming personality). There’s definitely a spiritual connection there and I'm insanely lucky to have him sing this next album. check him out:Cameron Gray is my Australian art love story, he created the art to ALCHEMY and he will continue to create magic filled pieces of art for my music for as long as we both shall live, or in an attempt to be less dramatic, for this next Meytal album. I figured I'll share with you some of his amazing work, to get your juices flowing, and gain an inside look as to what the album artwork might look like!Some of you know my weird fetish for making packages - well this is truly my time to shine. Fulfilling my last Kickstarter was kinda like opening my own little sweatshop, only instead of enslaving kids in Bangladesh I enslave my close friends, same result and slightly less evil. But in all seriousness, I personally put tons of love in each and every single package, those of you who have been following me for a while have gotten familiar with the added organic lollipop which you can expect to receive again this time. I do it for you, but it doesn’t hurt that I get to eat lollipops all day, while making packages - a classic win WIN.As a THANK YOU for backing this project and by doing so MAKING IT POSSIBLE for me to grow as a human and as a musician, while all at the same time decreasing the percentage of music that sucks here on planet earth at this time…. you will be getting this KS exclusive album, as well as the extended digital download which will include the art, the lyrics, some tabs, some pics, some videos, and a piece of my hair. JK. but you get it, lot’s and lot’s of good goodies.ALSO I’ve put together a list of spacial items and some one-off’s! My plaided drum shoes (which I wore to death in so many of my latest videos) my used cymbals, my white DW performance series drum set, my orange cast from the skateboarding fiasco, and THE infamous skateboard itself which someone should have already taken from me really, for the love of god. this will be a Kickstarter Exclusive Limited Edition.. we love those - they bring us closer together.My debut album Alchemy came to life thanks to you guys, matter fact my entire career did, and ultimately you guys will decide where I go next.. for those of you not familiar with how Kickstarter works - this album will ONLY come to life IF I reach my goal. it’s your support ALONE that will either make it possible for me to create this second album, or immortalize Alchemy as the first and last ever MEYTAL album!Following a dream of turning a hobby into a career consists of high doses of uncertainty, not knowing where to go next and just hoping things will somehow magically work out - not a simple path to walk for sure, but you know what? about 10 years ago a terrible car accident broke my back, BROKE it. and weirdly enough the settlement I got was the sole reason I was able to support myself while making videos for you guys and gaining over 200 MILLION youtube views. Life is painfully unexpected, and we can’t ever really see the big picture.. something you thought was pure bad luck could eventually prove to be just what you needed. so here’s for things working out just as they should, and to a new and amazing chapter - let us just hope I won't need to break my back for this next one..Huge thanks to each and every one of you reading this now. if it’s liking, commenting, sharing, buying an album, coming to a show or showing the dude at the grocery store one of my videos, YOU bring my dreams to life, YOU are the reason I’m 34 years old and never had a boring job in my life. it's been a sweet ride, couldn’t have done this without you - can’t wait to see what comes next!See you on the other side!Meytal}","Tue, January 2 2018 12:00 AM EST",{},8491,1,"{It's a pleasure to be a supporter of your next project Meytal..

The first album was amazing!;Glad this is happening I was left wanting more after the first album. I look forward to hearing this while I injure myself on your skateboard haha. I will use the pads though because I actually have broken my arm before skateboarding when I was too cool for safety gear lol.;Backed with no hesitation based on 2 things.

I do think that you deserve our confidence.;So let s go huntîng the unicorns!!;@Bored Gamer
Please note that HOPE Backers always have had updates about the situation.
Production is done and games are on their way to the backers. We waited for a long time this situation to be 100% managed before launching a new project. Also as promised in this first campaign, we refunded backers who didn't want to wait the time we switched from a factory to an other adding for sure an important extra delay.;Thanks @Romain Bre for your trust and sharing your thoughts about it!;@bored you’re right talking about the hope project but I don’t agree with you on the idea @morning will do the same on each project
They kept the KS profile so everyone can go on their profile to check the previous campaigns and what went wrong.
Everyone needs a second chance and failing is a form of learning. If you don’t trust them I don’t see why you should keep on backing this project.;@Morning I wish you luck, but some of the things that happened with Hope may be seen by some as integrity issues that are not corrected merely by experience and people should be aware of that so they can decide accordingly and set appropriate expectations if they decide to back.;@Bored Gamer
There is no wish on our side to hide what happened on the past projects. If you are referring to HOPE that we ran last year on Kickstarter, this is mentioned in the Risk & Challenge part at the bottom of the campaign.;Here is what you can read:
""Our previous Kickstarter HOPE has taught us many invaluable lessons and also armed us with the knowledge on how to avoid, and resolve each single thing that can be thrown at us.;We cannot promise there will be no bumps in the road, but we are going to be more realistic with the promises made to the backers and we will be open about the potential issues we may face during and after the campaign."";I would strongly encourage anyone who is or is thinking of backing, to do their homework on this company and it's past projects. There is a reason they aren't flaunting them the way most creators do.;Thanks a lot guys @here!

Vinci 2.0 is a standalone computing device with a Quad-Core ARM Cortex A-7 processor and WiFi, 3G cellular and Bluetooth connectivity. You can ask Vinci to make a call, send a text message, set a reminder, or give you directions. No phone is required so you can carry less and workout more.Vinci 2.0 integrates with Spotify, SoundCloud, Amazon Music, and KKBOX, with a library of over 42 million songs while leaving your phone behind. Vinci 2.0 can receive push notifications directly from your phone no matter how far away you are from it.  Whether you are lifting weights, jogging, or cycling, just ask Vinci for your favorite songs, request songs by specific genres or moods, or let Vinci recommend a song for you, 20+ languages supported. Vinci 2.0 uses a bone conduction mic for crystal clear voice recognition, even in the nosiest environments. This technology is deployed in mission critical situations (military, emergency services) for near-field voice recognition. Ambient noise is filtered out and only the speaker’s voice is collected and amplified. With this technology you can whisper voice commands in a noisy gym or make sensitive calls on a busy street without raising your voice.Vinci 2.0’s AI works on 2 levels. First, it learns from your music listening habits and physical statistics to make intelligent music recommendations. Second, it uses natural language processing (“NLP”) algorithms to recognize your words and understand your intentions. All of this allows Vinci to recommend music that best matches your query, mood, location, and activity. Vinci 2.0 has over 10 built-in sensors to accurately analyze your fitness and health data. Vinci 2.0 is fully integrated with Amazon Alexa, with English (U.S.) English (U.K.), English (India), German and Japanese. Also, we will support google assistant later, which supports 20+ languages including Spanish, French and Italian.   Vinci collaborated with one of the greatest industrial design firm to create the most comfortable and ergonomic fitness headphones. Vinci 2.0’s unique “pentagon” shape is designed to fit perfectly and flexibly around your neck. Vinci 2.0 only weighs 86g and has a holding force of 150g so it’s very secure. No matter what activity you are engaged in, Vinci 2.0 will stay in place - even during the most vigorous activity. Vinci’s subtle style goes well with whatever outfit you’re wearing, from athletic wear to a business suit. In addition, Vinci 2.0’s long-lasting 600 mAh lithium-ion battery is designed to charge quickly and last the entire day.Vinci 2.0 earbuds are highly customizable, and each Vinci 2.0 package will include a set of replacement earbuds and ear fins in various shapes and sizes . Listen with your headphones to get the real effect of Vinci 2.0's 3D sound.    Thanks for your support and understanding! Since 2014, our mission has been to reinvent headphones. Pioneering something no one has done before has been challenging, but you’ve carried us through.In November 2016, we announced Vinci 1.5 and in just 37 days we raised $987,384 from 4,885 backers and also received 3,446 comments. Thanks to this support, we were able to win top Awards and was featured at NFL Super Bowl LI.Now we are reinventing headphones again and announce Vinci 2.0 - the First Standalone Smart Sports Headphones, which let you workout without phones and completely hands-free. For the first time, music streaming, calls, and fitness tracking are integrated into a single device.Our mission will always remain the same - to reinvent headphones. We would love for you to join us on the next chapter of our innovation journey, for Vinci 2.0 and beyond.The Vinci TeamInspero Inc. was founded in 2014 by two MIT Alumni, David and Max. The company’s vision and mission is to completely rethink headphones by inventing a new way to experience -- and interact with -- sound.The Vinci team now consists of 70 talented and passionate headphone geeks with many years of experience from companies such as Intel, Oracle, and Microsoft, and from universities such as MIT, Harvard, RISD, and Parsons.We are spread across the globe, with offices in New York, San Francisco, Beijing, Bangkok, and Shenzhen. Our main offices are in China; this was a strategic decision to take advantage of China’s robust and ever-innovating supply chain.“Vinci” stands for invention. We’ve innovated before, and we’ll innovate again -- this time even more radically.Like what we're doing?

Follow us on our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/VinciHearableIf you’re a member of the press looking for info or media assets, please download our press kit here, or contact us at press@inspero.im. International backers: We will ship Vinci worldwide, with the exception of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Myanmar/Burma, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, and Yemen. Please note that you will be responsible for duties, fees and taxes applicable to your region, which in the past have ranged from 0% to 20% in the US and EU countries, to as much as 200% for certain South American countries. Estimated delivery: Each reward tier may have a different estimated shipment month. While we do not expect these to change, the estimated shipment month might shift. We will provide updates if the estimated shipment date changes. At anytime up until your headphone has shipped, you may request a full refund by emailing ks@inspero.im. Warranty: We stand firmly behind our products. Each Vinci headset includes a 7-day (after you receive it) money back guarantee, 6-month free exchange period, and 1-year limited warranty. Need help? We're here for you. If you have questions at any time, during or after the campaign has closed, you can always reach us at support@inspero.im. Disclaimers notifications: Vinci headphones must be connected to the internet via either WiFi/3G or to a smartphone via Bluetooth in order to receive notifications and perform other functions. Heart rate monitor: Vinci’s heart rate (HR) monitor is intended to be a valuable tool that provides an accurate estimate of the user’s heart rate. The HR monitor is designed to monitor a user’s heart rate on a periodic basis. The frequency at which heart rate is measured varies and depends on the level of activity of the user. Vinci headphones are not medical devices and you should not rely on the accuracy of the heart rate data for any purpose, especially for medical or health purposes. Battery life: Actual battery life will vary based in part on cellular network performance, location, and other factors. 3rd party applications: For 3rd party applications that are not native to, or built into Vinci’s operating system -- such as Spotify -- you must already have an account set up to use these services with your Vinci device. Additional fees and costs may apply to any such services. Use of third party services is subject to these services’ own terms. Trademarks: Trademarks and names that belong to third parties. Water resistance: Vinci is splash resistant but not waterproof. Incidental exposure to water–like unforeseeable rain–won’t ruin your device, but submerging the device is not recommended. }","Sun, January 14 2018 1:00 PM EST","{Dear Backers,;Over the past couple weeks we've received so much support from the Kickstarter community - both from all of our backers and from other fellow Kickstarter projects trying...

1. can i use vinci 2.0 in my country? since i have a reference for the frequency here --> https://www.frequencycheck.com/carriers/telkomsel-indonesia
2. if i didn't connect to any network, what kind of vinci's feature that i can use without network? only play offline stored music?
3. i dont get it for how to use the AI. you said that we need to logged on to Alexa account so i can use Alexa AI, but if not, by default i can use Vinci AI. what is alexa account ? and how to logged in from the vinci?;thanks!!;Hi Vinh I have more suggestions for the product
1.Custom Eq for the low frequencies lover I loved harder bass in my headphones
2.body temperature sensors
3.motion sensor that's automatically counts your reps like the TrackFit sensor in the Jabra Sport Coach headphone that The feature I want to see in premuim headphones;I got a question on the gesture control, saw from video that just wave at the sensor on one of the earpiece we can skip a song etc.;I am just wondering how close our gesture need to be from sensor? one scenario that i can think of is during a crowded train ride will others standing beside me activating the sensor if they are really close by?;Will I lose any functionality if I use only 1 earbud? Are most of the sensors for fitness/tracking/heartbeat in the neckband? My place of work may allow me to use this while working-maybe. But it would be easier to be approved if no one had doubts about my ability to hear. One earbud is a compromise I could live with-if I don't lose most functions. By the way, did you guys ever try a more covert wire design? Like behind the ear and over the top of the ear for the earbuds and the neckband connection further back towards the back of the ears? If so, how did it work out? I kind of find the wire placement a bit obtrusive(to be fair, I may feel different if I tried them on);Hi, can Vinci AI recognize Chinese language if not will it be added in future? Btw i love the fm radio suggestion!;Lastly can the Vinci count the number of steps walked while we keep it around our neck? And keep records of our steps and heartbeat records in the Vinci app as well.;@Adam White Great question! Vinci 2.0's ANC comes with 8 different profiles so you can tailor the level of noise cancellation to your activity/environment. We know it's important to be able to hear some level of street/traffic noise when you are on the road, and through the ANC profiles you will be able to find the best balance between music clarity and outside noise.;@Average Joe Thanks for your questions!;Does voice recognition work when Vinci 2.0 is connected via Bluetooth with Smartphone?
There will be limited voice features on the Vinci side when bluetooth paired to your phone -
primarily just calling and texting contacts on your phone. The rest of the Vinci features/commands will be dormant while you are bluetooth paired to your phone. It will be your phone that really dictates what you can hear on your headphones and when you can talk and use the mic on your headphones.;Also, is it possible for you to include Internet Radio to the current media streaming apps?
It should be possible, let me check with the team and see if we can add it.;Thanks again for your questions and for your support!;How will these be good for cycling if you can’t really hear the traffic that’s around you?;@JohnnyBravo Thanks for your question.;To be really honest, integration between Vinci and Apple (music, siri, etc.) will likely never happen. Apologies for that, but it is pretty well documented how Apple likes to keep everything proprietary and keep users only within their Apple product and software environment.;@JohnnyBravo Thanks for another great question. Regarding accents, we have plans to integrate Vinci 2.0 with Google Assistant to provide support for 20+ languages beyond just English. What is your native language? Google Assistant probably covers it.;And if you do prefer to speak to Vinci in English, it can handle slight accent in English. To be honest, most of our testing for Vinci has been done with standard American English. But I have had friends from many different nationalities try Vinci and Vinci has never had a big problem with accents.;@JohnnyBravo Thanks for your comments.;Noted on your suggestion for vibration alerts, I will mention this to the team and see if we can add it.;Regarding bringing the bone conduction technology to the listening side as well as the mic side, this is difficult to implement as it would require a complete design overhaul of the headphones. Components in the neckband would be affected and the earbud experience (with gesture control and audio drivers in each) would be affected as well. The earbuds we have developed for Vinci 2.0 are able to deliver premium HiFi audio and also come with sensors for gesture control - great sound quality and interactivity, and we don't want to risk these features to redesign for bone conduction listening.;Regarding your comment on adding more differences between the versions, I believe your comment here undervalues the differences we have already placed in each model.;For Pro vs. Lite we have brought in ANC (active noise cancelling) which is really a huge feature. Many major brand headphones only have this one feature as their main selling point and charge $250-300+ per headphone (vs. Pro at $149). And the value of ANC really goes beyond just money. There is also a factor of your music listening preference. Each person is different. There are many people who really value the ability to listen to their music with as pure sound as possible, with as little ambient/environmental noise as possible. Some people listen to music to escape, to focus, etc. I am not saying you don't either, but ANC can help with that.;For Super vs. Pro we have introduced the bone conduction mic which is also huge. In terms of monetary value, there is definitely value in the bone conduction mic vs. the dual-array mic in hardware/component cost alone - and we note that no other major market brand headphones are using this microphone technology.;But additional value from the bone conduction mic is really unlocked by you - the user. If you see yourself using Vinci 2.0 in more crowded/noisy places more often (subway commute, gym, etc.) then there's really no dual-array mic that can perfectly separate out ambient noise the way a bone conduction mic could. You would need to find a quiet place, or cover your mouth when you speak, or yell, or some combination of all of that. However, if you do not see yourself using your Vinci 2.0 headphones so often in noisy places but more often in more chill/quiet places (like a quiet cafe) then there is not much value in the bone conduction mic for you. It really depends on your lifestyle and needs.;@wicked68@gmail.com We will be releasing an update on Stretch goals soon - stay tuned!;@wicked68@gmail.com Thanks for your comment. We've definitely grown a lot as a company since 1.0 and 1.5, and we can't wait to show you our latest 2.0 product!;Thanks for your support!;@Truckin Tortuga To your second question - yes, the Early Bird Super includes all the same accessories as the Holiday Special Super.;To be clear, all Vinci 2.0's will come with the same accessories - charging dock, charging cable, and set of eargels/earfins.;When we originally published the Super Early Bird and Early Bird pledge packages we didn't put all the wording in about the accessories as we thought maybe it would make things too wordy and distracting on the page. And after we got backers for those pledges we aren't allowed to edit the pledge anymore as per Kickstarter rules.;The only difference the Black Friday and Holiday Special pledges are supposed to have versus other pledge packages is free shipping.;Apologies again for any confusion, and thanks for your time and support of Vinci 2.0.;@Truckin Tortuga Thanks for your comment and thanks for pointing that out!
The March 2018 delivery date on that the Holiday Special Vinci 2.0 Super pledge was an honest mistake on our part. Really sorry about that.
I have ended that pledge package and posted a new one with the correct April 2018 delivery.
Apologies again - we have your pledge still and of course if we can ship by March 2018 we will. But very likely we have to stick with the original timeline April 2018.;Many apologies again for any trouble or inconvenience caused here.;@Inspero - Does voice recognition work when Vinci 2.0 is connected via Bluetooth with Smartphone?;Also, is it possible for you to include Internet Radio to the current media streaming apps? Spotify connection requires premium membership and Amazon Music is not available in most parts of Asia where I live.;Thanks.;There is option that's in the future Siri (Apple assistance) will work with Vinci?;Hi Vinh, also what about people that don't have English accent how the voice assistance will work for them ?;Hi I want to suggest vibrate when you get call or alerts that's would nice, also there is more features from the bone conduction technology I was hear about bone conduction headphones in the past What about integrating this technology into the hearing experience?,also I think the premium products should have massive different from the lite version that's will attractive more people and more premuim pledges instead lite pledges, please See it only as an opinion;Any stretch goal to update storage in the Lite, like you did for the Vinci 1.0?;Had to wait for a good deal, free shipping is it. Had to pay $30 on the Vinci 1.0, which I don't even use that much, hahaha. This seems worth it for under $100. We'll see if production has learned it's lesson from the 1st go round;One more question. Does the ""Early Bird"" on the Super also include everything as in the Holiday Special price? Early bird states only the device itself, with no accessories.;Hi. The ""Holiday Special"" price for the Super states March delivery instead of April. Is this correct? If so, I am going to change to that one.;@Leesa Thanks for your question. Currently we have it so they are saved to your headphone. It should also be possible to save it on the app as well - let me check with the team.;Where do the voice recordings get saved to? the Headphones or the app on the phone?;@Shiva Siddharth Thanks for your comment. We are almost there with Google Assistant integration. When it is ready we will make sure to let you and all our backers know!;There has been no official mention of the headphones supporting Google Assistant. Can you please confirm that?;@Edwin Klesman Thanks for your great questions! I'll be happy to answer them below.;1) We already have this features :) Vinci allows you to record messages and play them back on your headphones later;2) Yes, If Vinci is bluetooth paired to your phone you can use Vinci as your mic to your phone;Hope that answers your questions - please let us know if you need any more info.
And thanks for your support for Vinci 2.0!;@DanielTheFirst Thanks for your comment and for your great suggestions! I will bring this to the tech team and see if they are already working on this or if we already have this covered in the OS.;Love the product and was glad to see I could just jump aboard on one of the last two super early bird backing plans.;My questions:;1) since i'll have the super with bone conduction microphone: is it possible to annotate a text with Vinci? This would be an awesome addition if I can layout a product idea or take a note in a crowded room by just whispering it into my Vinci..;2) if the Vinci is paired with my smartphone using BT, can I use it as a mic (and use iOS notetaking for instance?);Hi Vinh I want to suggest gym mode in the app that will count my rest time and count down 5,4,3,2,1.. And go voice and when I finish my reps I will press the touch screen and startover my rest time that will help me alot ,also I want to suggest that Vinci will have several timers to know my overall workout time also;@Shiva Siddharth Thanks for looking out for us! We will be ok - as you noticed we did add some packages, the Holiday Special packages. But they are the same as the Black Friday packages - added free shipping. Please let your friends know free shipping has been extended so they can get in on the offer.;And thanks again for your comment and for your support of Vinci 2.0!;Guys, you seem to be introducing new pledges and increasing the available number of pledges as well. Recently, Mobvoi did the same thing and got themselves into a logistical nightmare.;@Ryisan Champion Please double check and make sure money was taken. Because that is not the way Kickstarter works. You are asked to put in credit card info when you pledge. But no charge is made to your card until the end of the campaign. We have zero control over that - this is Kickstarter policy. If money was taken out of your account, then I suggest you contact Kickstarter immediately to find out what happened. Payments on Kickstarter are handled Kickstarter - not us.;Wait the money was taken out of my account already so that would mean a refund and i do t want to cancel i am still interested and still hope you can work this out i believe in you guys;@Leon Thanks a lot for your comment! :)
We do try our best to be responsive. And likewise we really do appreciate how active our backers are with their comments and suggestions. We are excited for Vinci 2.0 and can’t wait to bring it to all of you soon!;@Vinh Hey thanks, that's weird hahaha. Anyway, glad to see that the creators are so responsive, it's a great feeling as a backer knowing that you don't have to wait days for a response to a simple question. Keep it up, the campaign's going great! ;D;@Leon Thanks for your comment. I believe you may be looking at old/incorrect survey link.;This is the survey link we just recently sent out: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/GJLYVWH;There are 6 quick questions, and none of them ask about color.;The colors we have available for Vinci 2.0 are still the same - red, white, black, blue;I saw the survey you sent about the colours available to pick, it was white, grey and black. However, your campaign page specifically showed red, white, black and blue. So what happen to the missing colours and why is there a grey now?;@Lynn Thanks for your comment as well - really appreciate you sharing your thoughts here. We are definitely taking the survey results very seriously and are trying to see what we can do to improve Pro beyond the features we have already included (please see my below comment to Ryisan Champion). We have added so much already, it is tricky to add more without sacrificing on cost or features. But we will keep trying (that's the point of the surveys) and will keep you updated.;And to your point on trying to get more sales. With all due respect, I believe your comment is a little unfair. If I were a backer I would want my project creators to achieve as much sales as possible. Because virtually all of the money is going into your final Vinci 2.0 product! With more pledges we can have more budget to add more features and further improve Vinci 2.0 for you and all our backers. Believe me, NO ONE at Inspero is getting rich working on Vinci 2.0. We are just a small headphones startup that is passionate about the concept/idea we have created with Vinci 2.0 and are eager to get it out publicly as soon as possible and see what people think.;We will keep trying our best to improve and bring the best experience possible for Vinci users. Thanks again for your comments and for your support of Vinci 2.0.;@Ryisan Champion Thanks for your comments. We upgraded the Lite based on overwhelming feedback from backers and prospective backers. And I can assure you we are considering what else we can do to further upgrade Pro beyond the WiFi, 3G, ANC, Bluetooth, DAC, HiFi/Dirac HD audio, dual drivers for earbuds, CPU, RAM, local storage, health sensors, GPS, LED screen, dual-array mic, custom Android OS, custom Vinci AI, voice control, gesture control, Spotify/SoundCloud/Alexa integrations, and more.;We have put a ton of features in Pro at an incredibly low price point ($149) versus other major market brands that don't even offer half the features Vinci 2.0 has. It is not so simple to add more without raising price or sacrificing on features which we believe are core to the experience we want Vinci users to have. But we will keep trying to see what else can be added and will definitely make sure to update you.;And just to note, you don't need to ask us for a refund. At anytime before the end of the campaign you can click ""Manage my pledge"" and chance/cancel your pledge as you desire.;Thanks again for your comment and for your support for Vinci 2.0!;I kind of agreed with Ryisan. Much have been said to review and consideration for add-ons but no actual commitment given to Pro and Super model. Two surveys conducted and Inspero is still talking about the 18% cash back instead of using actual improvement to attract more backers. I'm beginning to feel that the Inspero is just trying to get more sales .;I still feel cheated i mean i really don’t want to ask for a refund but i really need to know you are going to do something for those who ordered the super early bird pro because they wanted oled only to have you upgrade the cheaper lite i mean i could’ve stayed on lite i don’t mean to be baggy or annoying but you keep saying you’re thinking of what to do have you come up with anything yet ?;@DanielTheFirst Thanks for your question. On a hardware/system level, Vinci 2.0 has all the components necessary to calculate calorie burn. On the software/app side we are still working on the final details of what fitness/health stats will be tracked right out of the box - will keep you updated!;@Matthew.Tay Thanks for your comments! Really appreciate your support for Vinci 2.0! Regarding stretch goals, we considering this now and will hopefully have an update for you all soon. Stay tuned!;Can't wait to receive this awesome product.
Just wondering, with the pledge nearing to $400k, any chance to improve on your stretch goals? 18% cashback for every dollar referred /raised, is not attractive at all... hope for more improvement in terms of the hardware and software for Lite/Super/Pro instead... :);Hi Vinh, I wonder if there is a calorie burner sensor like fitbit,garmin watch and etc;Hi Vinh, I wonder if there is a calorie burner sensor like fit,garmin watch and etc ?;Hi Vinh, I wonder if there is a calorie burner sensor like fit,garmin watch and etc;@Dane Cruickshank Thanks for your questions. Yes, you are correct - Vinci 2.0 is fully standalone and use all its features with no phone required. You just need to connect to the internet either via Vinci 2.0's built-in WiFi connectivity or 3G cellular. You can access 3G in a couple ways. Vinci 2.0 comes with a built-in SIM card slot (nano size) where you can insert SIM cards just like you do with your cellphone. You can choose to borrow the SIM card from your phone and insert it into your headphones if you plan to just be out jogging for an hour or so. Or you can buy a prepaid SIM card so you can have just enough data to stream music while you are outside during the week.;}","$20,000",43,395648.8,"New York, NY",364,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/inspero/vinci-20-worlds-first-standalone-ai-sports-headpho,13,"{Frequently Asked Questions

Built as a kinetic storage device, Be. harnesses and amplifies the power of 2 simple twists into over 80,000 tartar fighting brush strokes using its patented multiplier transmission system.     Battery & Electric-Free - Brushing with Be. means no cables, no batteries, and no problems. Transform your daily brushing routine into a simple 3-step process: put toothpaste on the bristles, give the dial two full twists, hit the power button and let Be. work its magic. Sustainable - Practice zero waste at home with Be.’s 100% biodegradable brush heads and recyclable build. The first toothbrush that gives you all the benefits of clean teeth, at no expense to the earth. Smart Technology - Be.'s smart sensor operates at the ADA recommended precise tartar-fighting pressure of 120g, training you to brush thoroughly but consciously. With 80,000 charcoal infused brushstrokes at the perfect pressure, you're off brushing for a diamond clean smile. Travel-Friendly - Whether you're traveling for business, backpacking outdoors or just bringing your toothbrush to work, Be. keeps up with your on-the-go lifestyle. The snap-on case creates an easy to carry cylinder and fits 1 extra brush refill for extended travel.                    Simplify Your Routine - Be. keeps your daily brushing routine easy, similar to your manual brush.If electric toothbrushes are so good, why do the majority of people still use manual toothbrushes? Well, manual is easy, and as a species we like easy things. If you haven’t made the switch to electric yet, don’t! We have good news. With no batteries, PCB boards, soldering, or wires, Be. is still a manual toothbrush for all intents and purposes. Two twists of the dial and no charging needed has you brushing like you would with your manual toothbrush, but with 10x the cleaning power.    Improve your Dental Health - A deeper clean that changes your tartar fighting game.Most dentists will suggest using an electric toothbrush to get that diamond clean smile. Why? It’s proven they do a better job at getting debris out of your teeth, avoiding plaque, cavities and tooth decay. With over 80,000 brushstrokes, Be. has more power than your average electric toothbrush, cleaning deeper and whitening faster so you never have to worry about compromising your oral hygiene for sustainability. As the ultimate hybrid, you get the best of both worlds by brushing with Be.        Every year, 15 billion batteries are discarded worldwide and only 1% of them are recycled. We know it’s bad but let’s face it, it’s hard to feel like one person can actually make a difference...until now. A vital part of your everyday just turned eco-friendly with no added effort. Be. is 100% recyclable, biodegradable and, of course, battery-free, making every brush a daily step towards reducing our carbon footprint and the release of toxins into the environment.   Minimize Your Waste - Everything down to Be.’s packaging, is considered and conscious.Be. is made from 90% post-consumer material and is 100% recyclable, biodegradable, and of course, battery-free. Be. has developed a proprietary material made of starches and bamboo that is 100% biodegradable and compostable. This material is used in all of it’s premium brush heads, which are engineered to be as small and as efficient as possible. Every purchase of Be. comes with a 1-year supply of replacement heads to minimize the energy and carbon of bi-monthly refill shipping. Don’t forget recyclable packaging too!    With 80,000 oscillating brush strokes per brushing, Be. uses Binchotan, also known as activated charcoal, in its biodegradable bristles to help with Ph balancing, odor absorption and anti-microbial purification. While Be. is deep cleaning at lightning speed, it’s also consciously aware of how much pressure you’re applying at all times.    A Stroke Speed that goes Beyond Electric - Be.’s patented technology doubles down on the most efficient way to clean.Be. has fine tuned its internal patented Be. Clean Technology to deliver a whopping 80,000 brush strokes per brushing. After 2 minutes, it automatically shuts down and needs a simple twist to get back to brushing. If you were to use a manual toothbrush and brush your teeth 80,000 times it would take you over 4 hours. Put simply: What a manual toothbrush does in 4 hours, Be. gets done in 2 minutes.    Save your Gums - Be.’s smart pressure sensor is built to stop you from over-brushing.While it’s not common knowledge, the American Dental Association recommends brushing your teeth at 120g of pressure, or in other words, the weight of an orange. Be. is designed to operate at the exact 120g pressure, halting agitation when the limit is exceeded and training users to brush thoroughly, but consciously. This technology will help save tooth enamel, reduce gum recession, increase the longevity of bristles and keep costly dental bills to a minimum.   Purify with Activated Charcoal - Innate Benefits infused in each bristle.Binchotan, which may sound more familiar when referred to as activated charcoal, is infused in all of Be.’s brush heads. Today you might find activated charcoal in ‘detox’ drinks, but traditionally it has been used for air and water purification. Be. has now incorporated it’s innate benefits to target mouth odor, balance Ph, and stop unwanted anti-microbial growth. With every oscillating brush stroke, your teeth, gums and breath are getting a healthy dose of binchotan to combat signs of gingivitis for a healthier mouth.               Made for You - Limitless usability designed with you in mind.Gone are the days of needed charging stations, cables and plug adapters for travel. Brush your teeth at the airport, on the plane, in a forest! The boundaries are endless. Whether you are a sales manager, a backpacker or a touring musician, you’ll appreciate the freedom of not having to plug yet another thing in. Cut out excess baggage when you bring Be. to work and avoid the dreaded scenario of your brush running out of power on the road. Be.’s versatility makes it perfect for anyone, from the mountains to your 9 to 5.    Do more with less - Power never looked so simple.Weighing in at just 6oz and only 6in tall, which is approximately 2 inches shorter than some of the newest products on the market, Be. is designed to fit in your purse, in your desk compartment, or in that last bit of space left in your almost overweight carry-on. When you are constantly on the move and trying to manage space for your essentials, size matters, and Be. makes the cut.   Snap-on and go - The perfect case you didn’t have to purchase separately.Be.’s travel case simply snaps onto the toothbrush housing, perfectly matching the body design to create an easy to carry cylinder you can bring everywhere. It protects your brush head from dirt and debris while travelling, as well as any bathroom mishaps when it’s on your sink counter. The snap-on case can also house 1 extra brush refill for extended travel so you keep what you need for clean teeth in one place.         Every year, 15 billion batteries are discarded worldwide. 87% of of them end up in landfills, 12% of them are incinerated, and just 1% are recycled. If we lined up all the batteries back to back that the world uses in just one year, it would be 466,000 miles long. That is long enough to wrap around the globe 18 times!When it comes to Lithium batteries in particular, the stuff is downright nasty. Lithium is flammable and highly reactive, as anyone who has seen photos of a burning hoverboard can attest - but that’s the least of our worries. The EPA has linked the use of extremely powerful solvents in the creation of lithium electrolytes and cathodes to everything from cancer to neurological problems. Specifically, the cobalt used in the creation of the most energy dense lithium-ion batteries is poisonous and extremely carcinogenic.   Tooth decay is the most widespread chronic disease worldwide. It’s most common as a childhood disease, but it affects people of all ages throughout their lifetime. Untreated tooth decay causes pain, and it affects 7 out of 10 children in India, 1 out of 3 teenagers in Tanzania, and almost 1 in 3 adults in Brazil. With Be. it's possible to deliver a professional clean, even without infrastructure like an electric grid.  From coast to coast, we've all witnessed or experienced the devastation of our changing climate. Doing our part to help take care of our planet is an important mission for Goodwell Co., and the products we make signify our dedication to our sustainability initiative. With electricity as a non-issue, the goal is to ultimately provide a small step towards maximizing relief efforts.            Goodwell + Co. was started 3 years ago with the goal of creating sustainable toothbrushes and oral hygiene products. Our absolute favorite brand on the planet is Patagonia, and we are forever inspired and motivated by the vision of Yvon Chouinard. Following in that vision, Goodwell has made the promise to ourselves and our customers to always make the very best products in the most ethical and environmentally conscious way. To date, we’ve sold 1 million premium manual and 100% recyclable toothbrushes. We’re also proud to offer all natural Pacific Mint toothpaste with compostable packaging, and GoodFloss, our 100% biodegradable flossers. We believe that sustainability is not only what your products are made of, but also how they are made, and how long they last. Our promise to you is a lifetime of using Be. We built this brush so that it can be worked on if anything ever goes wrong. Send your Be. back if it’s not brushing at its best and we’ll repair it or replace it for free.

Learn More - Be.’s lifetime warranty, perk details and how it works.Why should I buy Be. with a high international shipping cost? We've heard your concerns with shipping, and want you to know we've done our homework to get this cost as low as possible. At this time, what we can offer is an additional year's supply of brush heads with all international orders for FREE, a $20 USD value. That's 4 additional brush refills on top of the year supply that already comes with every Be. How much does it actually cost Goodwell + Co to ship internationally? If you check usps.com, a $50 item shipping from Portland, Oregon (our Headquarters) to London, UK is $22.50. This doesn't include packaging materials and labor costs. The total with those additional costs is more than $25. We hope our added extra brush heads with each international purchase lessens this cost burden and we truly appreciate your understanding.What is the Sustainable Lifetime Product Promise? We believe that sustainability is not only what your products are made of, but also how they are made, and how long they last. We promise that you will be able to use Be. for a lifetime. Unlike all other powered toothbrushes, we built ours so that it can be worked on and repaired, and if anything ever goes wrong with your Be., we'll repair or replace it, for free (you pay for shipping).When can I expect to receive my Be.? We will be diligently updating our post-campaign status, we want everyone who helped us reach our goal to have transparency on where we are at in the process. Right now, the plan is to have all of the kickstarter backers their Be.'s in-hand by December 2018.Why will it take that long to fulfill? A year may seem like a long time to wait for your Be. brush, but to put it in perspective - our team has brought literally hundreds of products to market, and the average time it takes to do it successfully is 18 months from start to finish. We are pushing really hard to get this done in 12 and if we get it done sooner, you will be the first to know!How do I use the Be. brush? It's super easy - Step 1: put a pea-sized dab of toothpaste on the bristles, Step 2 : give the dial on the bottom end of the brush 2 full twists, Step 3: press down on the power button - that's it!How do I stop it if I don't want to brush for 2 minutes? Great question, the only thing that is different about using the Be. brush is that you have to give it a twist before you use it, otherwise, you just use it like it's your favorite electric toothbrush. To turn it off, just hit the power button. Note that you have some power left in your brush, so the next time you use it, you may not need to give it the full 2 twists.What happens if I over-twist it? We've designed it to stop when it's fully charged, so you should actually twist it until it stops being able to twist. You can't over-twist, so as our pal Sam Cooke says ""twist the night away""!Can Be. get wet? Be. is designed to be in extreme environments, the outdoors and even in space (yes, space, it's the unofficial toothbrush of space), so yeah get it wet, it will be just fine.My dentist recommended that I only use an electric toothbrush, is Be. dentist recommended? We have shown Be. to a handful of professionals in Portland, and the feedback has been nothing but great. We are taking the steps to get Be officially recommended by the ADA as well as endorsed by local dental practices.What is Binchotan? Binchotan is essentially the best version of activated charcoal, which has been used for decades in things like air and water purification. Activated charcoal helps eliminate foul odors in your mouth, as well as balance the pH and fight the germs that cause gingivitis and tooth decay.How do I get brush refills? If you need more brush refills, they will be available on our website at www.thegoodwellcompany.com, as well as stores across the US. If you want us to be carried at your local store, please reach out to us via email, and put us in touch with your local grocery or retail.The brush refills are biodegradable? Yes! We have put so much effort into creating a commodity product that has little to no impact on the environment, our brush refills are compostable and biodegradable, when you are done with them you can toss them in the compost, in your trash or just bury them! They take around 270 days to decompose.How many brush refills come in the 1-year supply of replacement heads? Be. comes with 1 head on it and 4 in the box, so 5 heads total. The annual refill packs will be 4 as well.Are your products cruelty-free and vegan? Yes they are! All of our products are not tested on animals, vegan, and carbon neutral.Can I change my perk?

As I say to my kids “it’s how you well you brush, the time is irrelevant..” and “the timer doesn’t tell you if you’ve finished, or done a good job..”
Brush your teeth until they’re clean, not for some arbitrary set time - who decided 2mins/30sec intervals anyway?? :-D;Just my 2 cents: I like the quad pacing and find it a useful guide. That said, I would not want it at the expense of a mechanism more prone to failure. I assume there is no simple way to toggle on/off this type of feature given your mechanism, but I'm not an engineer. May be worth 5 minutes of thought;@Preston, @Wes Ewing, @Pavel Benes : We hear you loud and clear! Thanks for the feedback =);I agree. Quadrants are excessive and I end up getting confused where I am at with all those beeps going off.;I agree.

Please, do not make it over complicated! Every feature like this just increases the chance of failure in the future. The simple the better.;Pretty sure the 2018 delivery is correct. There’s no way these can be produced in less than a month. Besides, the growing trend with Kickstarter campaign is to promise a delivery that’s in the near future so that folks won’t be put off by the actual delivery date and just delay the product after the time comes (and the product has already received funding).

The first in a series of 12, Aquarius was designed for all those who appreciate the union of art & science.The Press Kit link contains videos (with and without markup text), images in various sizes, and GIFs for all interested media write-ups.Aquarius is built with 60 individually addressable LED lights.  By varying a portion (or all) of these LEDs at a frequency range of 75-100 Hz against a synchronized and vibrating stream of water, we can create ""snapshots"" or ""frames"" of the water at various places in time.  A set of these ""frames"" can form an illusion of an animation.  The animated water appears to bend, freeze, slow down, rise upwards, or even split into multiple streams.  By applying different LED colors, Aquarius can create even more mesmerizing displays such as gradient layering, multi colored streams, and more.The transparent property of water allows for maximum light dispersion in outlining the stream at exact moments in time.  And because it's simply water, users can touch it without affecting the visual effects (it will splash if you touch it though!).The scientific term for this seemingly impossible visual display is Persistence of Vision.  There are many resources available online where you can learn more about this, here are a few: Note: You may have noticed that there were lines in the promotional video and the GIFs here running up and down. Those are simply camera artifacts caused by a combination of shutter speed, frame rate capture, and variable LED strobing frequencies.  You won't see those in real life!The shape of Aquarius is symbolically tied with its corresponding Zodiac Symbol, sign of the Water-Bearer.In keeping with its motif, the Aquarius fountain was designed to resemble 2 different symbols: the water vase, and a water teardrop.Both the fountain frame and base are built with high quality Baltic Birch plywood sourced from a Canadian distributor. There are also 4 wood dye color options available as an add-on (finished with a water-resistant gloss seal):Aquarius can cycle through 11 different patterns by default.  This is all controlled by the aluminum dial at the front of the frame.If a COMMISSIONED reward tier is chosen, then one of these default patterns will be replaced with the custom designed one (of your choosing).We will be regularly releasing new patterns (full source code) as we discover them so that users can choose to program it themselves.   Note that all DEFAULT patterns shown here may be subject to change depending on community feedback.The Aquarius code was built with the FREE Arduino IDE platform.  Adventurous users will have complete control of patterns by coding it to their liking.  Start off easy by changing colors of the existing patterns, or alter the direction by varying their frequency!  Venture into more advanced techniques such as chaining animated demos or vanishing streams before your eyes!Custom programming Aquarius will require a mini USB cable and PC connection, and the Arduino IDE platform (or other similar supported IDEs).  The USB cable is not included but can easily be found at any place that sells electronics.There are 7 reward tiers available, 2 of them being limited early bird specials:All Aquarius Reward tiers by default do NOT include wood dying/finishing.  This is so that users have the freedom to stain/dye/paint their fountain or decorate it with graphics and more.  We made this decision due to collective feedback from the maker community.  However, we highly recommend to at least finish the fountain with a water resistant sealer as any splashes may cause unexpected blemish and expansion of the wood.If you would like us to dye and finish the fountain, you may pledge an additional $50 CAD on top of your Aquarius pledge.  The dye colors are subject to change, currently we offer Charcoal Black, Walnut, Royal Blue, and Emerald Green.  The colors will be sealed with a water-resistant gloss (lacquer or polyacrylic).If you would like to have the design files and BOM list, you may pledge for the ""Design Files/Source Code"" Reward tier OR an additional $20 CAD on top of your existing Aquarius pledge, we will include all design files, a BOM (Bill-Of-Materials) list, and source code should you want to create one yourself.  Note however that some parts will require significant investment to produce such as the PCB, 3D printed parts (SLA recommended to prevent water leaks), the wood frame (which requires a CNC), and many other internal parts.Alternatively, you can pledge for the ""Design Files/Source Code/PCB"" for $40 CAD which will include the PCB and all necessary circuit elements pre-soldered for you.  Note that similar investment is still required such as the 3D printed parts, LED strip, water pump, wood frame, etc.Shipping (includes tracking) is $50 CAD for international, $30 CAD for Canada, and $35 CAD for United States.Users can also pledge the commissioned tiers.  This allows you to describe a pattern of your choice (within reasonable limits) and we will code it up and ship it.  Whether you want a pattern of colors that matches your nations flag, or the feeling of a calm serene walk through a forest, or even a disco party flair, we will design it to your needs.  Please refer to this UPDATE that lists what you can and cannot do with regards to the patterns:>>Commissioned Pattern Update Rules<<Note that due to the time and communication involved in designing a commissioned pattern, the delivery date will be a bit later than normal for these pledges.Our minimum (break-even) goal of $22 000 CAD will cover our initial injection molding costs from ProtoLabs as well as allow purchasing all required pieces to make ~60 Aquarius fountains.Overfunding will be used to expedite work orders with additional hand-resources and/or upgraded tools and equipment.Any leftover funding after delivery will be used to develop infrastructure for our future projects (Gemini, Aries, Libra, etc.).This is a rough outline of our schedule that we intend to meet.  Although we can't predict delays, we have tried to mitigate that in many ways already by securing our injection molding partner (ProtoLabs) who are a very reputable (and publicly traded) company based out of the United States.  Our electronic parts are readily available from many vendors which means there shouldn't be any delay with procuring them.We have 2 woodworking partners (one as a backup) to help cut the frames for us. Both are also local (Canadian!) to squash any problems with timely quality control (which are typically associated with offshore sourcing).We've ensured to the best of our ability that any potential delays resulting from the project will be due solely to our own actions rather than external forces such as contract manufacturers, shipping, etc.  Due to the hand-made nature of Aquarius, the long-haul bottleneck will be in how fast we can build each piece.Though all the technical details of Aquarius have been finalized, there is still some leeway we have for improving upon the frame design.  What you see on the images and video here may be subject to change based on collective community feedback (though not by much).Details such as wood dye color selections and small dimensional adjustments to the base or upper frame are all on the table currently.We will update everyone on any aesthetic changes that we plan to initiate.Due to wood grain unpredictability and the hand-sanded/stained/polished nature of assembly, Aquarius fountain and base texture will not look exactly the same for every user.  Every fountain will be hand-made and thus unique.In addition, the water funnel displayed here is an FDM 3D printed version.  The actual version will be a translucent white injection molded piece and much more aesthetically pleasing.My name is Stephen Co, and I've been in the engineering industry (specifically ASIC hardware) for nearly 10 years now.  I led the industry's first set of PCI-Express 3.0 graphics cards to market during my time at AMD Inc. and published a solo patent out of it which you can find here.  My interests are primarily visual sensory experiences (hence my time at AMD), the maker community, and art.  At one point, I stumbled upon the field of KINETIC art from the awe-inspiring Sisyphus project.  I realized that by combining my love of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics with this field, I could create NEW sensory experiences for users to make them wonder in amazement and understand how things work through their own curiosity.I started digging up interesting science experiments around May 2017 and researched how I could create a product out of those.  I then saw videos about levitating water which you can find here, here, and here and I decided to turn those lab experiments into a viable product for users to enjoy in the comfort of their own home.After a few months of prototyping work, I ly finished my version of the levitating water experiment and aptly called it Aquarius.  The name, as you may have guessed, has alot of symbolic meaning with the art piece and helped guide its design.I want to demonstrate through Aquarius that it is possible for art to be integrated with STEM (Science-Technology-Engineering-Mathematics) and to create these new experiences that take advantage of the tools of our generation.  These experiences should hopefully lead people to amazement, curiosity, and eventually a proactive understanding of how the world works.If you would like to connect for professional purposes, don't hesitate to add me on LinkedIn (button below).

It would make it more extensible in terms of adding patterns and/or switching between them and also make it easier to turn off the stream (by pressing the rotary) rather than rotating it all the way to the left. The only reason I left this out was I was afraid of the rotary click degrading after repeated usage (they are usually rated 20 000 clicks). It would also remove the need for a capacitive touch sensor since the rotary can be pressed.;Hi Stephen, thanks for your nice Aquarius project. May I ask you to answer some technical questions? 1.

Thank you!;Hi Stephen!
Thanks for your comprehensive reply. It all sounds good. I am sold on your product, so please don't get me wrong when I through out some thoughts...;You said the position of the dial could be changed. Now that wireless connectivity is off the table - I appreciate the effort you put into evaluating the option - would it be easier/ possible to maybe add a capacitive sensor to the Aquarius? Maybe on the side or back?;The idea of a second input method is the following : by pressing the sensor cycle one could change lights only, lights and water. The dial could then be used to cycle through different modes in the current state. If water is running, it would not really change how the dial works. If water is off, the dial could go through programmed lamp modes (preset color, intensity, pulsation settings) or one could even extent the function of the dial by accessing extra programs if it is turned while the sensor is touched /pressed.;Of course only if such a change to the circuitry would not delay the schedule significantly. I think the software/ control implementation should not take long or could be developed after shipping. Until then it is just a sensor with no function...
Thanks for your community interaction and taking the backers serious :)
Jan;@ Gaurav, I'll try and get one up though I currently only have enough pieces to make 1 given the cost of the prototype parts. Since the walnut brown is already shown on the page, the other 3 colors are the options for the build. Another option is I could try and do a half dye on the fountain so it can cover 2 colors?;Hi, any chance to see a complete running fountain in different wood color options. Its a bit difficult to determine what color would look better with the lights and water on. I mean what we see is just the wood color but may be a complete model in the available colors would help with the our color choice decision. What do other backers think?;@ Jan:
1) There is no explicit on/off switch, the dial will turn everything ""off"" when turned all the way to the left. It's not truly ""off"" in a physical sense, but rather in a logical sense.
2) The dial is smooth (a potentiometer). This decision was made because a dial that ""clicks"" (ie. a rotary encoder) has a ""click"" lifespan of a few thousand usually. And since there are many patterns/modes on Aquarius, its expected that the rotary dial will deteriorate much faster than normal. Another reason is that a potentiometer dial is more cost effective than a rotary encoder and less work to wire up.
3) The code is heavily commented such that a user can easily find the global variables that control things such as a global timer. Patterns/modes have a bit more of a learning curve but they will still be located in an area that makes it obvious to most users.
4) I haven't had experience with arduinodroid but I would surmise there would be no issue if it acts like the standalone Arduino IDE. I just looked it up and it looks like a really neat app!;@ Levy, a smart plug would certainly work with the fountain in turning it on and off. It's really the dial position that remembers the last pattern. That is assuming the smart plug completely disengages the power from the fountain though.;IF I use a smart plug (for on/off/scheduling) would the last fountain setting reengage and reset the internal cock for the fountain pattern or would I have to reset the pattern?;Is the code written in a way that variables like the pump's switch-off timer are at the very front and can be easily changed?
Do you know if the arduino can be accessed via android apps such as arduinodroid? (never worked with arduino, so my questions here are very basic)
If so, maybe that would alleviate some of the connectivity issues in case no wireless gets added.
Best, Jan;Is there an on/off switch?
Is the dial smooth or do you have little clicks when turning?
Thanks, Jan;Regarding the switch, I love it just the way it looks!! Being on the side, would just not look symmetrical...;@RobV, thanks, I'll increase it to 6 hours. And I totally agree about the meditative aspect of it, especially for ASMR purposes (mileage may vary of course).;Hi - I agree with Kyle, I think a longer time period before auto-shutoff accentuates the artistic integration of the fountain into the home environment. The manipulation of light and water would, I suspect, be a great focus for mindfulness and other meditative practices. Shutting off after one hour just feels ---- wrong. Regards, Rob;@ Gaurav, no problem! I put alot of info out there, maybe too much and it might get overwhelming to find things sometimes. Better more than less :);Got the info. Sorry for not looking carefully.;Hi, whats the noise level of this fountain like? Sorry if this has been answered before.;Thanks for the thorough reply. And I can't speak for everybody, but personally I would love to see the timer increased to say 6 or 8 hour. I'm assuming the water would not evaporate in an 8 hour period (in any household). And that way water levels can be checked each time they turn on their Aquarius.;Once again though, just my own personal opinion.;@ Kyle, that's correct, it is currently set to shut off the stream after about an hour. In general, any powered fountain has an issue of water evaporation. Any water pump inside of a fountain (apart from the ones that cost hundreds to thousands of dollars) run the risk of a ""dry-run"" condition. This condition occurs when there is no water to carry away the heat brought on by the motor and will eventually cause it to seize up and stop working.;There is a very easy but rudimentary dry-run protection circuit I could build into Aquarius but even that isn't perfect. What I did with an early version is I used a wire to create a momentary current every few seconds and detect that on another wire. If there is a detection, then there is water in the tank and the pump keeps moving, otherwise the pump will shut off. I can easily add this back in, however, it will not last forever due to the phenomenon of electrolysis where the copper wire will eventually decompose from the application of DC in water. Comparatively speaking, a shutoff timer (like the one I have in Aquarius) is already better than most commercial fountains that have no protection at all. I can increase this timer to some other value but I would err on the side caution when running it for 24 hours. Adding in that wire protection circuit I mentioned would above protect it even more, and its something I can do with minimal effort.;As a disclaimer, I personally have run it for 24 hours with no issue but results may be different in other environments. Evaporation rates highly depend on the temperature, humidity, exposure to sunlight, etc.;I know that was quite a mouthful of information up there, hopefully that answers your question! Let me know if you want to increase the timer, and/or add in the wire circuit.;Maybe I am reading this wrong, but in the FAQ, it says ""the water stream will shut off roughly every hour, but the lights will remain on, though this can be changed in the Arduino setup"" (something to that effect). This was in reference. To water running low... That being said, will the water always shut off every hour? Personally, I think this is something I'd leave running 24/7, or for the most part.;An antiquing effect would be cool.
Great idea!;Michael, add the 50 CAD to your pledge. That will pay for the waterproofing. I dont think you will be able to add it after. Here is a thought....instead of looking at wifi for a stretch goal, maybe they can add more colors\glitter\marble effect\ to the staining. That seems like an appropriate goal for maybe 200% funded?;That's my fear as well, based on a few previous campaign I've been involved in and am currently awaiting resolutions from...
Added complexities create additional unforeseen problems/delays.
A Kickstarter reality.;I am also against Wi-Fi/bluetooth connectivity. If the Aquarius had been designed from the start with these features, that would have been a lovely bonus. However I'm perfectly happy with the current design and am also worried about the potential impacts on the final product and delivery times.;For example, I'm a backer of another project which decided to make a change to the product at a late stage. This change was very minor on the surface (much, much simpler than what is being suggested for Aquarius), but resulted in major unforeseen problems down the line. This has resulted in the project being delayed by more than a year.;I would hate to see that happen to Aquarius.;Well there be a survey at the end to add the waterproofing?;Also remember that this is a kickstarter item only. He isnt going to keep producing them. It would make no sense to have to completely redesign a product that is finished selling in 20 days. Although i am sure he is now aware of the wifi popularity to consider with his other zodiac based creations. BTW..Taurus. Just saying ;);The ability to update new designs as they're created is already built in vis-à-vis the USB port...
Seems adequate for an art piece of this type.;The newer designs could also come from the creator not just the tech savy types. Just some food for thought. I will go with what all agree to anyways.;Considering the Creator is offering all the parts...
Nothing stopping tech savvy types from customizing to their hearts content.
Delays of the magnitude suggested for such ""dubious"" or unecessary reasons is a deal breaker for this backer.;I also agree, that I am fine to go with what the majority of people want. And though Kari makes all good points, I believe that having WiFi capabilities will open up to the possibility of people being able to customize their designs as well. And I also have no doubt that some tech savvy person will create an app in time.;Just that having something to connect online opens up possibilities of adding more designs in future conveniently. And I think no one would say no to that. Anyways, I am fine with the way majority agrees.;This Lamp appears to be fully functional and quite simple in it's operation, hence my investment in this project.
Personally, I would prefer it if the Creator was spending his valuable time researching and developing new effects for the Lamp, (the effects are what attracted me in the first place).;OK, I get your point. Delays are not good, I understand that.
My worries with a one-dial-control is functionality, or the limits thereof. This fountain looks really cool and would be fantastic to double as a lamp. If there is a clever way to 1) activate lamp mode, 2) choose colour (would be nice, not mandatory), and 3) adjust brightness with one dial, I guess I would be happy. Otherwise I think some potential on awesomeness is not realised.
I would still prefer full control via smartphone...
My 2c.
Best, Jan;I also object to WiFi enablement considering it means pushing back development many Month's.
I prefer the current configuration as is.
No merit to connectivity in this case (in my opinion).
Maybe just simply moving the dial or making it more esthetically pleasing could be an acceptable compromise?
Sheesh!;@ Karl and Kari (and all others), the concerns are absolutely valid. Should this feature cause significant pushout of the delivery, I will forego it and instead provide the design files and source so that other users may continue the work (this would of course be on top of the original design files and source since they won't be compatible). I'll update again once I determine the feasibility of this within the schedule.;I am also disappointed that scope creep is pushing this project out months. Why in the world would a piece of kinetic sculpture need to be wifi enabled? And why does everyone have to wait longer because a few apparently do feel it needs to be?;While I am so happy to see that you are trying to please everyone, also know that there is nothing wrong with a good old fashion dial. Like seriously, does EVERYTHING in your life have to have internet access? Is walking across the room to turn a dial really that hard? And people who are happy with the current design will now need to wait MONTHS longer to receive this fine art piece because everything you own has to tie into your damn precious phone? Stop hounding this startup company and enjoy the product for what it is. Beautiful and elegant. Or buy the design and add your own wifi if you think this is so important and easy.;I'm hopeful that you can and will find a way to include some form of connectivity to this device - I'm not as stuck on wifi - bluetooth or zigbee would work for me. Thanks for considering these options...;Thanks for the swift reply.
By the way, I am one of those who would really like WiFi to be added. Actually, I think it's a little anachronistic to have a piece of science and art merged in the best sci-fi style that lacks basic connectivity. Changing colors and light intensity (no water) really makes it work as a night light or decorative lamp. Switching patterns via an app would also be lovely.
I do understand the increased complexity, but this really is something that I feel would increase usability tremendously.
Thanks!
Jan;Hi, I would love to see some wood color options too. I am also the sisyphus left out! :( your project is amazing!!!! Hope to see you guys go big as sisyphus. An app would be a great add on with the potential to add more designs in the time to come. Thanks.;@ Jan, that's a very good question actually. I think that it should be up to the commissioner. I will send those backers the question of whether or not they want to keep the commissioned pattern private or open it up for others. Thanks for the support!;Will the commissioned patterns be exclusive to the respective commissioner, or will you consider to release the code in the spirit of open source? Or will it be up to the commissioner?

We launched in the fall of 2015 with two flavors – Bird’s Eye Chili and Bourbon + Vanilla – and added Cardamom and Lavender extracts to our line in 2016.Founder Amy Nazer created Woodward Extract Co. because she couldn’t find quality, interesting extracts in local stores. Her love of science and food combined when she began making her own extracts and using them in her home baking and drink experiments, and that passion led her to begin her own business.Our small, woman-owned operation has come a long way over the last two years. We’ve participated in dozens of pop-up markets in Brooklyn and Manhattan, landed accounts with retailers and cocktail bars, and been featured in subscription boxes from Shaker & Spoon and Bespoke Post. This fall we moved on from Brooklyn FoodWorks, the culinary incubator that had been our home since our launch, and into a private kitchen.'TIS THE SEASONNow, we’re hard at work on our biggest project to date: a Winter Cocktail Kit with four seasonal extracts and exclusive new recipes created in partnership with two Brooklyn-based distillers, Van Brunt Stillhouse and Forthave Spirits.Van Brunt Stillhouse sources wheat, rye and corn directly from upstate New York farmers, making every spirit from scratch in Red Hook, Brooklyn. Their family of whiskeys give a nod to classic styles while remaining innovative to create bold and flavorful spirits.Forthave Spirits believes in crafting spirits that are natural and delicious. They look towards history for inspiration for every one of their botanical spirits and approach every aspect of their production and supply chain with care.Each kit will include one ounce bottles of Cardamom extract and three new flavors: Clove, Star Anise, and Sage. Printed recipe cards will walk you through creating a cocktail with each extract and a spirit from one of our partner distillers, and more recipes for each flavor will be included in a backers-only section of our website. All of the drinks will be easy to make at home with standard bar tools, and without any hard-to-find ingredients (other than our extracts, of course). Gift it to the cocktail lover on your list, keep it for yourself, or mix up the drinks at your next party. And remember that our Winter Cocktail Kit is a Kickstarter exclusive - you can only get your hands on one by pledging here before our campaign ends on December 14.WHERE YOU COME INIn early November, we started batches of our new seasonal extracts - our first production run in our private kitchen - so they’ll be ready to go when our Kickstarter campaign comes to a close. We’ve also finalized recipes for delicious drinks made with Van Brunt Stillhouse’s Bourbon Whiskey and Due North Rum and Forthave Spirits’ Blue Gin and Marseille Amaro.But we’re a bootstrapped small business, and right now there’s no room in our budget for custom boxes, design work, and packaging materials - the other elements to making this project a reality. So now we need your help to create a beautiful kit that we’d love to gift or get. Thanks for visiting, and we hope you'll become a part of our project! FINALLY, WE'RE SO GRATEFUL FOR...Sarah E.

Inspired by the golden era of skateboarding, the early 90s and early 2000, Session's primary goal is to make you experience what skateboarding really is; an incredible sport where there are no other goals other than expressing your creativity and achieving success through hard work, perseverance and bits of madness for no one else other than yourself. The main purpose of the game is to live the sport in its entirety. Feel what it is to be a talented street skater.  Explore and tame the concrete, film yourself, your friends and share your footage on the internet with the worldwide skateboarding community.Session focuses on the authenticity of skating, both in the way the game feels and is presented to the player.  Based on this philosophy, each feature makes the game even more innovative, fun and respectful to the skateboarding culture.  In Session each stick represents your feet.  From there, every skateboard is your instruction manual.  Just think about how you would move your feet or transfer your weight while on a skateboard and apply that to the sticks. In Session it’s not only a matter of getting on your grinds but it’s also important to work on finding the sweet spot in order to keep your balance, slide longer and have it steezy! Putting too much weight on the wheels while sliding will slow you down, reduce your ''pop out'' or eventually end up with a wheel bite. On the other hand, if you don't put enough weight, you'll end up falling or losing your trick. Eventually, you'll be able to apply some wax to reach greater distances but remember, it won't fix all your problems! Focus on what skateboarding really is! If a handrail inspires you to do a backside lipslide, then so be it! We won’t dictate which tricks are worth more. But if you really feel like getting recognition for your hard work, share it and maybe you’ll become a virtual pro skater.  Filming has always been a big part of the skateboarding culture. Session will feature an extended video editor that will allow the player to perform their tricks; edit, create a montage in-game and share it through all the most popular social media platforms (available social media platforms will vary depending on chosen game platform). Time to setup your spot lights! Whether you want to nail that rail gap as dawn light shines over the city, or are looking to tear up a pool at midnight, you can pick your prime skating time.Have your filmer friend ready and rip some sick night footage!  Those late night sessions are the best!  Session is not just another skateboarding game. It is something that will live on and grow with the community and with those who wish to get involved. Join us and turn Session into the most authentic game that represents what the skateboarding culture really is.Everyone’s unique, we know it but skaters need to show their colors. This is part of the skate culture and it’s no different in Session. From the type of the cap you wear, to the colors of your bolts, you'll have access to in-depth character and skateboard customization to show off your style!Session In-Game Character Model by crea-ture Studios on Sketchfab  Session’s progression system rewards those who repeat, persevere and keep trying. The more you do your tricks, the more consistent you become, the higher the pop, the easier the catch will be and more!The progression system in Session is based on what you do and how often.  For example, if you keep doing kickflips, you're gonna get better at it. You'll be able to flip faster when you need to, pop higher and have an easier time catching your trick. This way your skills will continuously open new venues and spots to shred!  However, if you think everything you gain stays forever, you're wrong! Like any other athlete, if you don't keep practicing, you'll lose that edge! Build a better tomorrow, with us! Session is built upon the concept of city hubs that will grow on a regular basis and evolve based on your feedback.With the help of heat maps and in-game feedback tools, we'll have useful information about skater habits across the cities, the most skated spots and what they like or don't like. This will help us identify what we should be fixing or modifying first! A spot sucks? Let us know, we’ll put construction signs for a couple weeks and we'll fix it. This skate plaza is always empty? Development metrics will tell us why and we'll redo it.     Every city hubs are directly inspired by real life cities with accurate and to-scale reproductions of their most legendary and best skate spots. Have a spot you want to see? Let us know! Session is the right place to be vocal.   Skate with friends online, have a game of skate on the couch, film a big part with your filmer friends or simply go to your favorite secret hubba and have a session! The filmer mode allows a second player to follow their skater friends online and film their performance live during the session. It also lets the player record movies easily while following their friends and find the best angles without feeling overwhelmed.  It's designed to help the player feel like a professional cameraman, with presets such as auto-follow, auto target, optimal angles and much more.

Because I have to get a new debit card number and I was wondering if I switch my debit card if I will lose my tier that I backed.;Hey C-S Team, the Score System we all doesn´t need thats right, but how is it about the Trick Names. i mean when i will gamin S-K-A-T-E with a Friend at Home, i must have a Proof ""it was this Trick"" is it in Work? What are the Community think about this? Thx;Hi guys!;I know its a very early question but I just want to know if this game will support 120/144hz ?
I ask this because I downloaded the demo and the GpU fan kicks in a lot when im playing this game (GTX 1080). I love to use VSYNC @ 144hz you know :P;Any way, hope to see a new demo soon! I want a bigger place to skate :P haha;Also, the LT/RT for turning is kinda complicated. Are you going to leave it like that or add option to swap to something else ?;Keep up the good work! :D;@Dave Handfield This is why we are taking this approach, by going with the core of the game first and offering stretch goals, we make sure the game is actually happening at least with a minimum viable version.;@Jesse Goldstein The stretch goal amounts is the total (pledge goal) amount we need to reach in order to develop each feature. These amounts are not added to our initial base goal of CA$ 80,000.;So, for example, in order for us to develop the Customization stretch goal feature, we need to reach CA$ 130,000 as a pledge goal, which is CA$ 50,000 more than our base goal.;Hope this helps!;@profbonkars this is a new studio and only 2 persons are working on the game right now. I think that if they want to deliver those stretch goal to the public without risking the quality of the graphic, they new to engage new programers and it would new way much more money. Right now those guys are not getting paid by any company because they are their own employer; that mean that they have to paid themself to work before paying more poeple that would work on others things than the graphic and programing the tricks.;pls don't be like EA, if the goal is to make a game rather than making money, at least put out the full game. it would be awesome to replay the game if the story is interesting. replayability would be a huge thing to consider.;I agree with other comments below. Why is so much money required for stretch goals that are kinda like really important to having a full game?;100k ^^;I'm not quite understanding how the stretch goals counter works. Are you saying you guys need 130k (130,000$) just so we can customize our character and board? and 510k (510,000$) just for a story mode? I'm just not understanding if that's how it is supposed to work. I already pledged for the half-cab tier and don't get me wrong, I'm not going to regret it. I'm so hype for this game I can't wait!! I have so much hope for you guys to make this because it is exactly what the skateboarding community needs! But if those are the kind of goals you're asking for, it seems like a bit too much. This is just my opinion and speculation. Please correct me if I am thinking about this all the wrong way.;}","$62,115",44,110423.99,"Montreal, Canada",130,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/100195109/session-skateboarding-simulation-game-by-crea-ture,19,"{Frequently Asked Questions

To get a pan like that today, you have to spend $100 or more. Together with the rest of our team at Greater Goods, we set out to make a 10” skillet that’s better than anything out there, at a price that is accessible to anyone. By using a modern manufacturing process to replicate the design fundamentals that have made heritage cast iron stand the test of time, we’ve made an affordable heirloom-quality cast iron pan.We knew our first challenge was to achieve the smoothness of a century-old, perfectly seasoned pan by machine etching and polishing the bottom and sidewalls of each skillet. We couldn’t find any other skillets at this price point with a smooth interior, and that was a deal-breaker; it’s a key part of making cast iron truly non-stick for the long haul. Also, unlike other high-end pans, we machine the sidewalls and smooth out the transition between the bottom and sides so cornbreads and cobblers will release perfectly the first time. The flat bottom fits any cooktop or campfire, distributing heat evenly across your ingredients.The seasoning process is the second key step in making your pan non-stick out of the box, and for years to come—but many mass-market cast iron pans are treated with low-quality oil or even paint, for cost reasons. We don’t exactly want that in our food. Instead, we pre-season ours with layers of organic flaxseed oil that we import directly to the factory from Canada so we can be 100% sure of its quality. It’s the same stuff you’d use to cook with at home; we’re just giving you a little head start. When your pan arrives, just start making your favorite foods to strengthen the non-stick surface naturally over time. Why Flaxseed Oil? Flaxseed oil is one of the only food-safe “drying oils”, which means it’s high in the fatty acids that create a durable seasoning layer. When heated, these molecules polymerize to create a hard surface that’s a natural and more long-lasting alternative to modern chemical non-stick coatings like Teflon. Most pans at this price point don’t use flaxseed oil because it’s more expensive—but we think it’s worth it! We import organic oil directly to our manufacturing partner so you’re only getting the best.Good cast iron is sturdy, and it needs a balanced handle that’s long enough for both control and comfort. Ours settles your hand naturally at the fulcrum of the pan, pushing up against the back of your palm for added leverage, with smooth sides to fit your grip.The thinner connection points transfer less heat from the pan to your hand. We also created a custom fitted silicone cover that insulates your hand without adding bulk. And, the middle groove holds a utensil handy while you’re cooking. The pour spouts on most pans just don’t work, plain and simple, so we went back to the drawing board. Ours are molded at the perfect angle to give you an even pour without dripping.We also designed a lid made to complement our pan, with a stainless steel handle and drip rings that redistribute condensation more evenly to prevent soggy spots in your food.  The Dutch Oven measures 10"", just like our first skillet—so your lid will fit both! It holds approximately 5 quarts, and like the skillet it's also seasoned with organic flaxseed oil, and has a milled cooking surface and sidewalls.We made a flexible scrubber that's easier to hold by wrapping chain mail around a breathable silicone core with a proprietary hexagon structure. Traditional chain mail scrubbers are great for cleaning build-up off cast iron without stripping the seasoning, but they’re essentially metal washcloths that feel awkward to use.Technical Specs   About Us: Greater Goods has been successfully launching best-in-category products at major retailers like Amazon, Target, and Bed Bath & Beyond for 10 years, and together we’ve learned what it takes to get a quality product to market on time, without shortcuts. Our goal is to make great products the right way, and give a piece of the profits back to our charity partners. We’ve gotten good at giving you the best version of a thing for a fair price—and now we want to do that for cast iron.    }","Sat, December 9 2017 12:55 AM EST","{DRUM ROLL PLEASE...

The lid is $15. The Dutch oven comes with a lid and that is $50.

Cortney - we have you down for your scrubber, thanks!
Mark - thanks so much, we've added that information to your order on our end.
Time_Stealer - the difference is the bundle comes with only 1 lid, when if you added the Dutch Oven after, you'd be getting 2 lids, because the Dutch Oven comes with a lid. If you have any other questions, just feel free to email us at hello@greatergoods.com
Len - thanks, understood. We have your note down on your order. :)
Gio/Time_Stealer - Great question. Our pans contain only cast iron and USDA-certified organic flax seed oil, and we’re taking all the necessary precautions to make sure no toxic elements ever make their way in. Our recipe of metals is free of harmful elements, but just in case, our melting process would be hot enough to evaporate them. Also, our manufacturing happens in a self-contained system, to avoid contamination from any brands with less strict quality control. We’re confident enough in the safety of our skillets that we’ve been using them to make meals for our own families for months :) If you have any further questions about our quality control process, please feel free to email us at hello@greatergoods.com.;Yes I too would like to know what kind of metal they all are as quality control is not one of China’s sting points.

Thanks!;I added an additional $58 to my pledge. $50 is for the Dutch oven and $8.00 is for an extra chainmail scrubber. Is that okay?;Hey Everyone, let us try and address all of your questions in one comment. :)
Navin - at this point we don't have a plan to sell in Malaysia, sorry.
John H - the iron will hold up in temperatures much higher than any residential or commercial ranges or stoves, however just as important your oil cure on the pans can begin to burn off once you approach temperatures at and around 450.
Mark - Yes, the Dutch oven includes a lid in the price.
sAfuRos - See above for your temperature question, and your dutch oven and lid will be just above 11 pounds in weight together.
Elden - Yes we plan to make a 12"" skillet, however, we don't have a timeline for exactly when that will be ready just yet. Feel free to send a note to hello@greatergoods.com and we'll be sure to notify you if/when we do have that ready.
Bill - we think you'll be more than happy with your pledge! :)
Will - Thanks for your pledge, we've added a note to your pledge, that's all we need. We appreciate your support!;Hi Creater,;I pledged $30 for the skillet and added $50 for the Dutch oven. Is this all I need to do to get both? Let me know. Thanks!;Just pledged for the Dutch oven. I have Field 8 & 10 skillet from the Field Company KS 2 years ago. They too made a very nice smooth thin wall cast iron skillet. Looking forward to this Dutch oven and expanding my cast iron. The cost point is fantastic, but hoping this is well more than lodge quality.;Will there be a way to get a 12""skillet in the future even if you do not meet your stretch goal?;Hey Great Goods team,;Excited about this project - two questions:;1) What's the temperature limit for the oven for the skillet/dutch oven and skillet lid?;2) What is the weight of the skillet and the dutch oven and lid?;...added $50 for the Dutch oven, too.;Thank you;If I add $50 to my pledge, does the dutch oven add on include the lid? Thanks!;I still use a Griswold skillet- my Mother’s family is from Erie, PA where they were made. Happy to back you!;Many Chinese ironworks focus on the cheap end of production so identifying the right foundry is really important. Thankfully you aren’t trying to enamel coat your iron because there is even more questions about quality and safety when Chinese-made (enamel coating iron is still done on a large scale in China, France, and Germany but not the USA). Forging your pans in the USA probably would double the cost...I, for one, would pay for that difference: please consider that for an add-on to unlock- but probably two different foundries is not viable.;Quick question:what is the maximum oven temperature for the lid?;@creator

If others are like me we just slide past any comment from you and your various alias .. it is quite clear that onion is no longer going to respond to you here..;@justin;you probably don't have an omega2 so you likely don't understand the severity of the wifi driver issues. all i want from @creator is a realistic timeline as to when the wifi driver issues will be resolved. their lack of response demonstrates that they have no intention of resolving the issues because it's not profitable.;you'll agree with me in a few months when the oboo turns out a complete disappointment, and @creator ignore all your communication because they've moved on to the next product.;I think this has great potential, and I also think that Chris D needs to stfu. Judging from how much of a response you've gotten on your comments (not for lack of trying), it seems like nobody cares about your spamming. Go have a whiskey, lay down and get some sleep. You seem to be a bit edgy, so I think you need it.;@creator;stop lying to your backers.;the omega2 is defective, and because you are refusing to fix the defects, the oboo will be defective as well. why can't you come up with a timeline to fix the wifi driver issue? most features on the oboo won't work at all if the wifi driver is defective.;@Oboo Backers

Thank you for your trust in the team! The support of our backers inspires us to make Oboo the very best smart clock that it can be!;@Chris Ouellette
While we appreciate your concerns, we consider the inner workings of our product part of the intellectual property of the company. Driving the screen was not the only technical challenge we faced while developing the prototype, but as you can see by our prototype gallery, we’ve successfully overcome all of these challenges.;I remain faithful because it's just one who likes to put the disorder. I think the product is going to be great and give up it's like give him reason. Well me, I chose to rest.;@Onion
I'm not sure why you are avoiding answering a simple question.
What protocol are you using to communicate to the LCD display?;I'm not asking for you to make your product open source. I am concerned that you are using the Omega2S that includes the MT7688 which has a HW issue with SPI and if you are using that SPI interface to communicate to the LCD display how can it not be impacted by the HW issue?

Some technical concerns have been brought up by someone who has been spamming this comment board. Although these technical issues in no way affect the Oboo Smart Clock, the following is our official response:;WiFi Connectivity Issues
The Omega2 fully supports 2.4GHz WiFi b/g/n networks with open security and networks secured with WPA2 or WPA1 encryption and AES or mixed AES+TKIP ciphers. These are the most common configurations for home WiFi routers.;WiFi Issues - Kernel Panic and slow transmission
Users have only encountered this when using the open source wifi driver created by the LEDE community. The driver provided by Onion works fully with the above mentioned network configurations. This is referenced in the thread from the Onion Community.;Enterprise WiFi support
WPA2 enterprise support is not a part of the feature-set of the Omega2 or Oboo, nor does it make sense since home networks will not use an enterprise-class setup.;SPI
The SPI driver is not developed by Onion and we are uncertain why this is being brought up here. But to assure our community, the driver with the known limitations does not affect Oboo or its operation.;Heat
The Omega2 is passively cooled, the shielding may get hot when the processor load is high. This is normal, expected, and happens to all processors; the shielding acts as a heat-sink to dissipate excess heat. The passive cooling design is commonly used in similar devices to avoid the need for noisy fans.
Additionally, the Oboo uses the Omega2S, a surface mount version of the Omega2 that was designed specifically to be embedded in commercial devices. It also features a thermal pad on the bottom that allows it to use the entire PCB as a heat-sink.;We're so close to 250k, hopefully you add Google Integration regardless if we hit or not. Excited for this product!;This comment has been removed by Kickstarter.;I am not sure what happened in the past but the creator should make them clear. If not, I will consider to pull out my pledge.;This comment has been removed by Kickstarter.;@James English
Right now the plan is to ship with the features that are on the campaign page to ensure a high quality product. So no Spotify when it ships.
We do like the idea and will consider implementing it in future software updates.;So is this going to be integrated with spotify?;This comment has been removed by Kickstarter.;This comment has been removed by Kickstarter.;This comment has been removed by Kickstarter.;This comment has been removed by Kickstarter.;@Chris Ouellette
While this is not the forum to discuss the differences between our other products, we suggest you take a closer look at the pinout diagram and draw your own conclusions :)
Oboo is a consumer product and we’re standing by our decision not to open source the designs;This comment has been removed by Kickstarter.;Well, your own description of the Omega2S on https://onion.io/omega2s/ doesn't indicate it contains any additional communications capabilities. If it does, you really should update that page to indicate it.;And since ""Omega2S ...includes the same MT7688 SoC Microprocessor, DDR2 DRAM and Flash memory used in the original through-hole version of the Omega2."" how are you getting around the HW issue in the MIT7688 SOC?;What protocol are you using in oboo to communicate with the LCD?;@Chris Ouellette
Although the Omega2 and Omega2S are based on the same CPU, they are different devices with different capabilities. For instance, the Omega2S has more hardware communication interfaces available, allowing for many more options when selecting peripheral devices.;Regarding SPI, we want to reiterate that this is an issue that does NOT affect Oboo. As you may already know, SPI is affected by a hardware issue with the underlying SoC that is not produced by Onion. The technical team was looking into the open source driver with the intent of contributing ideas towards a workaround, but did not identify any changes that would alleviate the data corruption.;@Patrick Green
To give you peace of mind, we are planning to extend preordering of the clock after kickstarter. In appreciation for our early backer’s support, funds raised afterwards will also count toward unlocking stretch goals.;I think you are being misleading with this statement: ""One more thing to add; the Oboo will use the Omega2S, a surface mount version of the Omega2 that was designed specifically to be embedded in commercial devices"";On your Omega2S product page you state: ""The Omega2S is a surface-mount packaged version of the Omega2 module"";The Omega2S has the same issues with wifi and SPI that the Omega2 has. I can't speak to the wifi issues as my Omega2 works fine on my wifi network but the SPI interface does not transmit the correct data. I believe you have implemented a workaround to the hardware SPI issue for the oboo since you are using SPI to talk to the LCD display. Can you release the fix so Omega2 owners can have it?;I did submit a ticket on this, Pavel responded with: ""We have found a resolution of the issue and we are just in a final stage of fixing the bug. The resolution will be released either this month on the beginning of December, please stay tuned!"";and closed my ticket marking it as fixed. It's not fixed till the fix is actually available.;@Onion Can you reduce the Google Home integration stretch goal to $200k? Given the current rate it's unlikely you'll reach the $250k goal.;This comment has been removed by Kickstarter.;Our Christmas card service will become available shortly!;This comment has been removed by Kickstarter.;This comment has been removed by Kickstarter.;This comment has been removed by Kickstarter.;@Darrel Raines
The tiers that are no longer available for pledging (super earlybird, early bird, etc ), have been removed from the list. Backers that have pledged for one of these tiers will still see it.
We've also decided not to extend the basic model under the Christmas promotion since it has proven to be the least popular choice.;@Darrel Raines
Thanks, we're doing our best!
With regards to the issues some users are experiencing with their Omega2 units, we would like to assure you that once we identify bugs, we assign each of them a priority based on how many users it impacts/how commonly the feature is used. Based on the priority of each, we fit the bug fixes into our development schedule sequentially. We are a small team and prioritize our efforts based on urgency and impact.
We would also like to add that the Omega2 is maker focused and uses open source software that is based on collaboration of the community. In addition to the fixes made by our team, we welcome code additions and bug fixes from all users if they're inclined to contribute.
Regarding the WiFi concerns you have, the Omega2 fully supports 2.4GHz WiFi b/g/n networks with WPA2 or WPA1 encryption and AES or mixed AES+TKIP ciphers. These are the most common configurations for home WiFi routers. As such, Oboo will also support these network types without issue.
One more thing to add; the Oboo will use the Omega2S, a surface mount version of the Omega2 that was designed specifically to be embedded in commercial devices, meaning that it undergoes much more rigorous testing both on the software and hardware side. The difference is that the Omega2S used in this application has a limited set of features that will be exhaustively tested, whereas, the Omega2 is ultra-flexible and meant to be a swiss-army knife type of device, making it impossible to test every possible configuration.
Additionally, as Oboo is a consumer product that will go through a rigorous gauntlet of QE & QA testing and validation for each implemented feature before we deem it ready to ship, including the WiFi connectivity. This commitment to shipping a very high quality product is part of the reason we plan to ship in June 2018 even though we had working prototypes ready prior to the beginning of the campaign.

Designed with a thin and flexible form factor, the Luminoodle Task is the solution to get light where you need it most. From the great outdoors to your home and garage, the Luminoodle Task keeps you going well into the night.Lighting should enhance everything you do, but the current solutions don’t offer the flexibility your varied projects demand. Too much time is spent dodging shadows or precariously balancing your flashlight instead of working on the task at hand - fixing, creating, lounging, doing. The Luminoodle Task was designed to be the right light in the right place for the right job.   Electric light is arguably the most important innovation in our history. It shaped the way we live and work. With the Luminoodle Task, we can finally shape light to fit our needs. We designed the Luminoodle Task to bend to your will, tack on to any metal surface, pack up small and easy, and fill any room with natural-looking, feel-good light. The Task uses an 80/20 blend of 6500k (cool) and 2700k (warm) 2835 LED light packets to simulate the full spectrum of the sun, resulting in truer color rendering and better feeling light.  The Task Link is our first ever linkable Luminoodle. Use the included loop rings or 6-foot extension cables to create your own super-bright 3 light system.         We designed the original Luminoodle in 2015 with the goal of creating a more versatile and functional outdoor lighting product. Our thousands of happy Luminoodle customers inspired us to extend the Luminoodle family, which now includes the Luminoodle Color, Basecamp and TV Backlight. We love the endless use cases for flexible LED light products and how the right lighting product can improve everything we do.Earlier this year, we were given a new challenge when a large company that loved the Luminoodle approached us with a unique use case. They needed a flexible lighting solution that was bright enough to safely maintain and repair large equipment but small enough to carry easily between job sites.  We went to work and found our early concepts of this utility light pretty exciting. It instantly had us thinking about the thousands of uses for this heavy duty, ultra-bright member of the Luminoodle family, so we decided to build out functional prototypes and bring it to the crowd! We really appreciate you taking the time to learn more about the Luminoodle Task. If you like what you see, pledge now to be one of the first to receive this revolutionary new utility light!  }","Thu, December 14 2017 1:59 AM EST","{Hey Backers,;For this weekend only, we have opened up three special Black Friday rewards levels that include:;Hey Backers,  ;For the ninth time in five years, we had the privilege of launching a new product to the magical realm of Kickstarter.

The idea of the Archisketch came from personal frustrations that we have repeatedly faced as Architects. In almost every renovation or interior construction projects;The traditional way of interior designing involves a tape measure or a laser with tedious steps of measuring, making notes, measuring again and so on. On top of that, you have to use difficult and expensive 3D software to build a model.The existing solutions were eitherArchisketch is a byproduct of countless hours of research on pre-existing solutions. Putting aside professional devices that were too expensive and not accessible to everyday people, the mobile application based interior designing software was simply inaccurate and fragmented.Our new measuring method combines hardware sensors and computer vision technology software, so you can get accurate measurements of lines, areas, and floorplans of enclosed spaces in high precision.Sensors within our hardware complements and completes the software side of Archisketch to innovate shortcomings of traditional measuring software - combining the pros to provide even more accurate AR driven measuring solution.Aside from the tools used and types of spaces measured, we measure spaces with a tape measure, put samples on the wall and floor in advance - just like the professionals -  to see how it would look while searching for decors presented on the web. It's a personal assistant in your pocket to fulfill your interests in designing your own home like the professionals do except that it is  Archisketch's laser pointed at the target accurately measures the distance between you and your object up to 1,574 inches (40 meters).         Following are the photos of the most up-to-date working prototype of the Accessory Module.  We’re redefining the way we design our spaces. While we’ve come this far with an incredibly small team and a boot-strapped budget, we need your help in making this technology a reality.Our goal is to not only develop a product but help educate the world on the potential of ARCHISKETCH. To do this, we need your support from this initial campaign to not only fund our production but also get the word out about what we’re developing. Our team got together for a habitat project, a volunteer activity group to build and design homes for disadvantaged people. After debating about Architecture and the problems that lie within the current system, Archisketch has been founded and joined by experts in electronics and telecommunication fields.Once we start manufacturing our products in the mass scale after a successful campaign, we would like to make a promise to you backers and Habitat Community that we will be distributing spare Archisketch devices to Habitat for free to support fellow volunteers that work hard for noble cause.OUR PARTNERS    This is the most capital-intensive part of our next phase. We’ve developed many products over the course of our careers, so we’ve got a very good idea on costs needed to produce the initial molds, purchase supplies, meet the minimum quantity order, and ship to consumers. We need your help to get us to the production phase of our hardware.    Even as we are running a Kickstarter campaign, we are still working hard to improve our product by listening to you. Not only that, we are constantly on the move to let the world know about our product.We will keep you updated on where and when to find us.PRANAV loves ARCHISKETCH!Pranav's research on SixthSense got the 2009 Invention Award by Popular Science. He was also named to the MIT Technology Review TR35 as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.Mistry has been called ""one of ten, best inventors in the world right now"" by Chris Anderson.

It will be unstable for three days.;@creator ive tried using the web editor beta, but the door/ furniture /paint list doesnt showed up, is there any plug in or anything i need to instal to show it correctly? Any advice? Tried using firefox and chrome same result;@Matthias, Correct;@Archisketch,inc: Thanks, so checking out update info #7 dated 11th November I now understand...
1. that the discussed V2 is an integrated version of the Archisketch laser device and the accessory module, but without a clear picture about when it might see the light of day..
2. so nothing but speculation about ideas on that V2 one, since that stretch goal is way too far away for 3 days left nobody will turn back to the drawing boards soon...
3. so the current state of affairs is the one we are backing works either with a compatible smart phone attached or with the accessory module for simple standalone operation and/or BT-connection for extended compatibility for smartphone operation...
4. and we are still talking May 2018 for planned shipping?;...right?;Great Product!!!! This is the one I've been looking for!;@Matthais, We are early stage start-up.Like what you mentioned in the comment, It will take a lot of effort and money to change the original plan while keeping the delivery date.That is why we set the high stretch goal in update # 7.(Of course we lower the stretch goal in a next update to accommodate backers feedback) Still, To overcome our compatibility issue, We set the first stretch goal as completing the add accessory module development. And follow through with every promise. Acc module has been well received by backers, and we are very grateful for this. We are doing our best. Please keep watching out for us until the end of our campaign. To be really safe, we will use 'BackerKit' to proceed Acc order.Thank you.;Hello all
i was't able to follow the discussions in all detail. Please, can somebody elaborate why a handfull of backers are talking about a second version, e.g. V2 of the Archisketch device?
This is very confusing.
At Archisketch, inc.: It's not clear why you don't simply allow upping the pledge amout via the Kickstarter website for purchasing addons when other campaings just do/did it that very same way.
The further stretch goals are completely out of reach, let's be realistic...
Please provide a statement to sum it all up - about where we are today and what further development can be achived in the time planned, and what is the realistic schedule from todays perspective for the device and the accessory module for delivery with those functionalities promised....
thx.;@Frank Richter, as you have mentioned, we work with manufacturers to share their libraries of 3D data with our users. On top of that, you can import/export your own 3D data and share with others. (Please take a look at our demo video showcasing the import function);@David, There is a camera module on the Archisketch device itself - so although the phone is not connected to the Archisketch device when the bluetooth module is on, you can still monitor the AR grinding on your phone.;@Rex, Currently we support gltf,mmd,stl,3ds,obj+mtl,fbx formats (You can both import and export them) and are planning to expand compatibilities to 2D formats such as DWG,DWF,DXF and STL.;Can plans and measurements be exported to autocad, sketchup or revit?;Thanks for the reply. What I mean more is that in your demo videos it shows AR gridding and very clear markers for plotting corners and thresholds when using a smart phone. When using the module will the camera be transmitting images via the module or will I just have to rely on the laser dot? It just seems clearer and more in-depth on the smartphone demo and I’m struggling to see how that can be replicated with the module.;Great idea using an andditional device to become independent from the phone type. I appreciate and support it. When will it be open for sign-up?
Some more questions: I understand the server software has a library of objects. Is there a chance to upload an ""own"" library of objects to be used? Could I open up this library to certain device users?
I am not sure if I got it right, but I want to use the device in a manufacturing environment for production ""interior design"". Therefore I need machines, etc. to be placed.;@Mark, Yes, Everything you have mentioned works without the internet connection.;@David, you can think of it as a transmitter of the data gathered by the Archisketch device (That also gives you measurements with a display on it). Therefore, if you are to use AR and enjoy full functionalities of Archisketch, you would need to use the mobile application with the bluetooth module communicating to your smartphone.;@Creator, I am not sure I fully understand the whole software side of this gizmo. In an area with no internet, what will I be able to accomplish? Will I be able to measure and draw up a 2d or 3D sketch? If the Internet is only for sharing files, then I am ok with that. But I will need the ability to take measurements, sketch up rooms, and export the sketch without Internet access. I intend to use an iPad for these efforts.;I would like to use my iPhone SE or even an iPad to work on. Therefore I’m interested in getting the module.
However, I’m a bit confused. Does the module still support AR modelling and 3D scanning? From the videos it seems to be helpful to have the screen active to anchor the grids/points correctly. But this would be missing with the module.
Perhaps I just don’t understand fully but could you help me to? Will I be losing some functionality by using the module instead of a smart phone?;@Good Thank you. We will do our best to make a perfect device.;I'm still excited and I hope you do well!;@Martin Fischer Thank you so much for your support!;Juhuuuu. I‘m in.
Great device. Looking forward to get it.;@vrmania Yes. You can make a 3d in your phone.

Again, thank you for your patience and stay with us until the end of our campaign.;@Cherry, We requested a refund through stripe service. Soon your refund will be complete.
And also we send you an e-mail. Please check your inbox.;I've already completed the Accessory at your website - what will happen now??;@Ann Pence, We requested a refund through stripe service. Soon your refund will be complete.
And also we send you an e-mail. Please check your inbox. Thank you;Creator, I got the email directing me to the site for the add-on, and I completed the process. I submitted my info to a non-secure site at your direction, and then you say don’t do it?? Are you going to cancel my order and refund my purchase because you’ve now decided to use the survey add-on method at the end of the campaign? Please advise.;@ MedicNYC, We are very sorry that we can't reflect all your feedback and please check out our latest update.;@Chua Chee Wei Kelvin, We are in early-stage startup. Please understand if isn't good enough. We will keep finding the way to accommodate backers feedback. And follow through with our words about dev update.
@ MedicNYC,
We are very sorry that we can't reflect all your reflect. And please check out our latest update.;I think Archisketch is new to how kickstarter functions, and new in doing business. Some of the points that is making me uncomfortable with this campaign.;1) U don't make backers purchase outside of your campaign unless ur product is live or the funding ended and survey sent.
2) Ur payment page is not secured (Feels like someone hacked the page to mine credit card info)
3) Internet to use device??? Seriously? Half the places we (ID and architects) go are under construction with no cell reception because no humans live there yet and cell satellite won't extend to a place with no people.
4) If backers are into this products, chances are they gonna use it more than once, so charging on software later on is like being microsoft all over again. kickstarter gives u the statistics of how many people are supporting this campaign. From my viewpoint, people who buys the business packs or partner packs will be using it EXTENSIVELY.
5) Promising a V2 when V1 is not even completed will only destroy your biz model. Look at ur tech partner companies (Samsung, LG and IBM), everyone knows there will be a better version, but u do not simply put news out on a V2 when V1 is not even live and in customers hands.
6) If we are into the field of ID, chances are we will be upgrading our hardware once every few years. So a high end smart phone is easy to get and with the release of newer phones, some businesses might just buy a second hand high end phone just for drafting. It's way cheaper than doing a custom draftsmen CPU.
7) Can the 2d and 3d be ported into auto cad? As much as this is easy and fast, end of the day auto cad is the gold standard for converting drawings into reality.;I'm not trying to shoot down the project, if this all goes well, it will save me heaps of time and manpower for my ID business. But i'm seeing too much of a trial and error movement here. That line between incorporating technology to reality is called practicality. U guys need to start thinking like an interior designer or architect, or better still, beta it with people in the field. I will wait till the last few days to decide if I should reduce my pledge to min just to be in the mailing list.;@ALL: WARNING... the site they are asking you to use to pay for the adapter enabling most devices to use the basic features of this project, is NOT SECURE. That means it's NOT ENCRYPTED. That means you are sending your credit card information in clear text so anyone can read it and ultimately may use it. DO NOT USE THEIR FORM unless they properly secure it with an SSL certificate.;Even if they do, it's inappropriate for them to be asking you to pay them directly for something that is part of the campaign. They either have to direct backers to increase their pledge or, as virtually all the other almost 100 campaigns I have backed have done, use a reliable post campaign survey company that will accept payments securely for add-ons.;Honestly I am shocked any company in this day and age so obviously puts your personal & financial data ask risk. It's bad enough when companies get hacked... but failing to secure your personal data is nothing short of malpractice.;@Guillermo J Wainselboim, Ann Pence, Andrew Hogg Could you please wait for a day? We are fixing the problem now.;Nope, The Form is not working.
as soon as I move to a different field the data I entered in the field I just left vanishes.
after refreshing the form and ensuring none of the browser security plugins are not messing with it I tried again, the form acts the same but when I go back the data is in the form.
The form will not submit saying I need to fill in the form.
I am happy to paypal the money to you.;Agree with Guillermo.;May I make a suggestion
Why not, when project is complete, allow for addition of accessories, through survey and credit card?
Will make everyone's life easier I believe;Furthermore, the site that you have linked does not allow for purchase of accessory, please assist;Thank you very much;@A.Schreier, please check our most recent update.;@MedicNYC, we would like to make clarifications on Features Vs. Connectivity. PC-mediated web-based software obviously requires the Internet to provide full features to the users
Device-mediated mobile application provides full features minus the sharing portion (sharing of your space or design via cloud) without internet connection.;This means that you will be able to enjoy all 3 measuring modes in the basement or off-grid areas where the reception may not be available.;Going back to mobile application & cloud based software (PC), we don’t have any plan to charge you on the software side.;However, we might have to come up with a new business model on top of the features we provide for free to cover up the server costs if server costs go up extremely high to the extent that we have to come up with something.;I must cancel, too. I said why but I am looking and waiting for V2, too.;@creator. I have to agree with MedicNYC. I too will be canceling my pledge for the same reasons.;Do I have to change my pledge plus 49$ to get the additional device or can I get it after the campaign?;@Creator,
Unfortunately at this point I will probably be cancelling my pledge for the following reasons:
1) An additional $49 to make the device usable with most devices.
2) No guarantee that the software will be free for backers for life. It's one thing to charge new purchasers once you've launched if necessary, another to refuse to assure your backers they won't be charged.
3) An apparent and surprise requirement that we be connected to the internet to use the device. That's simply not possible in a number of situations.;I had hoped you'd see the benefit of learning from your Kickstarter backers and producing the best product now rather than having people spend money on V1 only to turn around and have them spend money on V2.;That's 3 strikes.;I hope you will keep us informed once you're ready to launch V2. Good luck.;@Mr.Mo Thank you for your feedback. We will do our best to accommodate your opinion.;Nice to know, thanks by the way. Your device is a future product. I think a high end smartphone is no problem for the most users.;Is a PC version planned, then I think your sales counter will jump high like a rocket.;@Mr.Mo We are using AWS server, and We put every effort to maximize safety for the data. For more security and sustainability, You can always download your data and save it to your computer.
About, standalone program. Please consider the fact; installation program might need a high-end smartphone to use.;It is off course a fantastic and helpful tool and, yes I need it but... I am thinking about to cancel my support because the need of a server sided connection to using the device.;Because, I would like to keep my independence at the construction sites. And much more I have concerns about data security and sustainability.;A separate/standalone and perhaps a non-server supported software is actually a must for me.;How big is the chance, that you will implement this feature?;+1 vote for standalone software!;@Mark, Currently, Archisketch software is only compatible in conjunction with the server. If the demands for the standalone software rises among our users, we will definitely address that.

She desperately wanted to be able to share science with her children, but didn’t feel confident enough to do so. At the same time though, she was an incredible baker - she could follow a recipe with ease, and would confidently adapt recipes to create something new. That process of experimentation – of trial and error – is science…she just didn’t see it that way. I realised that if I could make science as accessible and easy to follow as a recipe I could help this mother – and many other parents - to build their confidence, and in turn share that confidence and curiosity with their children.As a nanotechnologist and engineering academic at The University of Auckland, New Zealand, I have worked all over the world in tech jobs. I am acutely aware of the importance of diversity in STEM – and the lack of diversity in some STEM fields. Two years ago I co-founded Nanogirl Labs, a social enterprise, to try and make a difference in this critical area. Sharing my vision for the book with my co-founder, we decided to bring this project to life. Now, after a huge amount of work from our amazing team, the book is ready to print!After scribbling down an initial collection of more than 200 recipes, we have selected 50 to be included in this first edition of The Kitchen Science Cookbook. With a community of over 2000 families from around the world, we tested each experiment, making sure that the ingredients and equipment required were easy to find in their home, or readily available nearby. We strongly believe that science education should be accessible to all, and to support that mission have chosen to distribute The Kitchen Science Cookbook on a ‘buy one, give one’ basis. For every copy of The Kitchen Science Cookbook purchased by Kickstarter backers, a copy will be donated to a school, library or community to enable those who may not otherwise have access to build their confidence in science.At its heart, The Kitchen Science Cookbook is about bringing science into the home; making fundamental scientific principles accessible, building confidence through experience, and creating memories of discovery and play that will last a lifetime - and hopefully foster a lifelong love of science.From all of us at Nanogirl Labs, we hope you will help to make this exciting project a reality. Please, support The Kitchen Science Cookbook. }","Sun, December 17 2017 12:26 PM EST",{When writing our cookbook we sent the recipes to over 2000 testers around the world.

The biggest part of Blue Omen is the role-playing aspect - as a story-driven RPG, we want to bring our own brand of bizarre to the table, with an overworld filled to the brim with unique characters and critters for the player to encounter. Those childhood memories of purchasing a game for the art alone; slotting it in and booting it up without knowing what to expect, only to be introduced to a unique and exciting RPG world waiting to be explored - this is the type of feeling we want to recreate.Developing that strong attachment to the unique faces you meet along the way is what Blue Omen is about.It's been 31 years since the discovery of the Blue Omen, a prophetic and ancient sarcophagus that had descended down from the depths of space itself. Since that moment, decades have been spent researching for answers as to the nature of this mysterious object, but the only things to come of it thus far are more questions. What exactly is inside this coffin-shaped artifact? Is it something to be protected, or is the coffin protecting us? An oppressive aura emanates from Blue Omen, and some fear that a time may come where the object inside will render the earth into a state of eternal damnation.One way or another, the truth will come out...  Jiro is a young man burdened with a terrible curse. After becoming the host of an otherworldly parasite, he has been granted supernatural powers. Though the benefits are great, it comes with a fatal price - one that leaves Jiro unable to sleep comfortably at night.Despite being burdened with this mysterious parasite, Jiro lives life as peacefully as he can. As a self-taught mechanic and automobile enthusiast (who knows how to work a wrench as well as he can style his hair), Jiro is a greaser down to his very core. Although he prefers not to fight, he can take hits like a tank, and dish em' out just as effectively. His rough-and-tough exterior might be intimidating to some, but to those that know him, Jiro is a good-natured man who is always willing to lend a hand to those willing to take it from him. In most other situations, he tends to keep his thoughts to himself (and his partner, Yagiko).  Yagiko is Jiro's faithful partner-in-crime. As a promising magus-in-training, her specialization in the Dark Arts is an invaluable asset for the two of them, despite how much of a troublemaker she can be.   With all things fantastical, Yagiko is as smart as they come - she knows the Netherworld like the back of her hand, can learn spells in record time, and is an exceptional navigator with no qualms about giving directions towards the nearest gas station. She struggles with more practical matters, confiding in Jiro when she needs help. Doesn't know how to swim, and sometimes gets stray birds caught in her hair. A little guidance is necessary for this punkish fiend.See the world through the eyes of Jiro and Yagiko as they travel the globe in search of Soul Lamps, treasures from a different dimension which house the souls of powerful and restless spirits!The Battles in Blue Omen are all about timing, and how well the player utilizes their ability to Dodge, Parry, and use special SkillsDodging allows you to avoid enemy attacks without taking damage. Be warned - learning your timing is essential, and certain enemies will try their best to slip you up!Parrying is a skill for those confident enough in their reaction time to bite back. When the time is right, a good parry will allow the player to cancel enemy attacks as well as deal damage at the same time!Skills are Jiro and Yagiko's greatest, well, skills! From the helpful heals of Jiro's Shock Therapy ability to Yagiko's electrifying Lightning Bolt, the duo can tap into a wide range of attacks, buffs, debuffs and more to turn the tides of battleIf you have the skill, it's possible to play the entirety of Blue Omen without taking even a single hit!The Overworld in Blue Omen is vibrant and deep, and like most RPGs, filled with things to interact with. Jiro and Yagiko like to play it by ear, so it's up to the player to guide them and find clues on where to go next. All sorts of things are hidden along the way, from secret items, friendly fellows, and crowds of monsters to fight through! No hand-holding for you!The world of Blue Omen takes place in a very bizarre version of Earth. Try traversing the wild and dusty plains of Pepper Gulch, the laid-back tropical city of La Pala, or the futuristic lands of Ranza! Many more locations will open up to you in time - some far more dangerous than others.  The enemies in Blue Omen come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, from the mischievious Witchy-Kitty to the pick-pocketing SmutMutt. However, a new threat with a dark agenda has been making waves... the secretive Ranza Army, who seek to change the very nature of this world.   The music for Blue Omen has been the solo-work of our very talented Michael Staple, whose past projects can be found here! He has continued to shine with every successive track he makes, and we're very glad to have him on board.Check out some of the wonderful work he's done so far: Blue Omen Operation: Victory Theme Blue Omen Operation: Cave Theme Blue Omen Operation: Mini-Boss ThemeAwesome, Right?Everyone likes a good reward, and we're here to treat you guys with the smorgasbord of gifts we have prepared for our backers. Check out a few examples of both our physical and digital merch:Show off your love with a set of buttons and stickers to play with, or a postcard to display as you like!

Add to the already-bizarre bestiary of Blue Omen by helping us design the colorful critters that populate this world! It doesn't stop at enemies - whether you're interested in making an NPC, a boss monster, or even a humble item, there's a plethora of tiers specific to your needs. No need to be an artist - flex your mind-muscle with us a little, and we'll handle the rest!To settle things down a little, we'd like to say that we're incredibly grateful to any and all people interested in our game, whether you're a donator or simply a fan. In the event that our goal is met (a heart-stopping idea on its own), we've set up plans to move forward with development to make sure that what you're donating to will not only be a complete experience, but an experience worth the weight of the love we have for this project. Technical issues come and go with each successive build we make, but our strict QC ensures that we squash as many bugs as possible between releases. With access to Beta-Testers, we'll be able to be as thorough as we need prior to release.The biggest challenge that we have for the game is simply the amount of work required to make it happen. We all work on other jobs separate from Blue Omen, and we will continue to work these jobs if needed. We are a small team and plan to stay fairly small. Other than severe injury, death, or Cox finally pushing Ink down the stairs, there are very few challenges facing us that we aren't prepared for.Bryan Cox, or known to most as just ""Cox"", is the Programmer/Game Designer of Blue Omen. He's wanted to make games ever since he got his hands on his own GameBoy Advance. He's been working on small games for years now, and is ready to make Blue Omen the best as it can be. Though he wishes he was playing Megaman Zero for the first time again.Favorite Games: Megaman Zero 1-4, Paper Mario, M&L: Superstar Saga, Legend of Zelda: Link to The Past.Inker, the artist and creator behind Blue Omen! Drawing ever since learning how to use his opposable nubs, he sports a captivating and charming art-style inspired by artists such as Akira Toriyama, Bengus and more! Hobbies include; figure collecting, playing videogames half-way and never touching them ever again and listening to 10 hour extended versions of his favorite songs.  Favorite games: Paper Mario 64, Mega Man X, Animal Crossing, Kirby Super StarMichael Staple, is the mad scientist behind the music for Blue Omen.

Favorite Games: Windjammers, Pokken Tournament, Aero The Acrobat, M&L: Superstar SagaWe greatly appreciate anyone and everyone who have supported us. Seriously. Blue Omen would have been dead in water without the community being as interested as they are. Every little piece of fan art or interaction has been amazing. We hope that the Kickstarter is succesful so we are able to give you guys the best product that we are able to.

I know it'll probably run fine in WINE, but native ports are always better;Love the concept, artwork, music, and gameplay shown thus far. It looks like a promising passion project. I hope that once it releases down the road we may see digital releases at the very least on consoles like the PS4 and Switch since I saw in the FAQ it's not a priority until after the PC/MAC release. But until then, I'm excited to see where Blue Omen Operation goes.;I love the art style and music, and the demo was really good. I hope the full game is just as good, or better.;Hoping in the future even if it takes a year after the game comes out, the art book in the last tier will eventually be made available for all.;Will the comic be a physical or digital release? And will it be an add-on to the campaign or available for purchase afterwards?;I wanted to back Jack & Casie, however I was a day late. So I guess I'm backing this instead, it looks promising.;The characters are really cool, and the trailer music is so good, I hope you'll be able to produce the game;@Gabriel Balda: Thanks for your reply! I've always found a PC to be both more convenient and economical than a bunch of consoles. Plus if you want to play with a gamepad and/or on a TV, you can just plug your PC to one. However, I can understand that for someone who already has a console, the option could be interesting. Your ""on the go"" argument is sensible too.;The art reminds me of the 80s Go Nagai manga somewhat. I'm digging it!;DRM-Free release stands for GOG? If not, please, make it happen.;So this may be a silly question, but does the beta-tester tier come with a postcard? Or is that just for the postman tier?;@clovis Not everyone enjoys playing on a PC, for me PCs are only for games where I need a mouse and keyboard, rest of the games are perfect on 50-60 inch TVs and play amazing. PLUS, having a Switch makes any indie game much more enjoyable by been able to play it on the go.;Okay, you've roped me in.;Nevermind, realized that it was meant for people who donate directly on paypal. With all due respect, my bad.;Maybe I am just completely missing it, but I cannot find the ""Notes"" option on pledges. I am just trying to fill out the information that is mentioned in the top of the campaign page. Anyone know what I am missing?;I don't get it: why is a console version such an important thing? Isn't it super easy to have a PC you can play BOO on? Why is a console version apparently such a necessity? Can anyone enlighten me?;It's a real bummer that consoles aren't a kickstarter option. I feel that A LOT of people would be willing to wait for the console versions to come out and would pay a little bit more for it as well (I know I would). I may back out and wait for console versions.;Read the FAQ and realized the console question I was asking. Will drop for now, see you later guys when buying a code for consoles is available.;Best of luck (not like you need it)!;Let's push it till that 50.000$ stretch goal!;Loving that Kaneda/Vegeta vibe Jiro gives.

Would backers will be able to pick a console code instead of the PC one when the game becomes available there?;I've been, unintentionally, following the development of this game on my Twitter feed for what seems like a year now and the art style always caught my interest every time I saw it pop up. Glad to see that it's finally getting the crowdfunding it deserves;love this game so much did a little youtube video of it: https://www.youtube.com/watch… just a real quick one going to up my backing for it in a few days, thank you so much for this devs!;I just played the demo and absolutely loved it! The only suggestion I have is to allow the player to skip dialogue before boss fights (at least after the first attempt). I thought the boss difficulty was nicely balanced, as I had to try 2-3 times to defeat them, but it was a slight annoyance to read all of the dialogue again. I noticed that, after dying from a boss, you give the player the choice of returning to the last save point or to the main menu. Perhaps you could add a 3rd choice that allows the player to immediately retry to boss fight.;Other than that, I thought the demo was amazing, and it solidified my decision to back the project. Can't wait for the full game!;P.S. - I gasped the first time I opened the inventory. Love that animation!;Three things I loved from the demo:;1.- The character is animated in 8 directions. It gives the game an isometric feel that I really like.
2.- Some games show static portraits in dialogs. You have dinamic portraits, and the sprites also change their expressions and are animated.
3.- The inventory... woah, that's a good design and functional. I love it.;Congratulations on 1000 backers, I'm glad I get to be part of this fantastic looking project.;Looking forward to seeing this project through, I love the art and music for it but the story is really interesting as well, keep it up! Wish it had an autosave feature at some points, though, as during the demo after a death I'd have to keep trekking my way back to the fight I lost and see the same cutscenes again just to progress.;I just started watching kill-la-kill for like the 3rd time. Just realized how similar the style is.;I am loving this game, I've followed it for a while even before this kickstarter and I backed it day 1, but I'm holding out hope you guys change the look of the gameplay a bit at some point in development. I love pixel art, but I'm worried the not-low not-high resolution you chose with the low level of detail in the characters and backgrounds leaves everything feeling a bit flat, and all the people I've shown the game to have felt similarly. Just chipping in because I'm excited for the game and want it to achieve its maximum potential!;I propose to create a Discord group to collect all these good fanarts that I'm seeing on Twitter, who 's in? P.S. Anyone has achieved to run the demo on Mac with Wine?;@Brianna thanks!;I would like to know if I decide to wait, does my pledge could go into a code for the console version?;I'd recommend reading the updated FAQ for anyone curious about consoles!;@Gabriel Balda Here we are, lol. The only things that we can do is hope (and spread the word)!;@Andrea I am feeling you! I thought one of the stretch goals was going to be consoles.;Can we assume that so seemingly physical stretch goals (booklet, shirt, art book) will be made into available add-ons upon reaching them, or will they be digital (digital books and in-game shirt)?;@Clovis Yeah your right. When I wrote the comment, I mainly had Bright Bright's meteor attack and the Catties's ram attack (where the go off screen). With attacks like those, it'd be useful to know which character to watch for timing counters, but those are only two attacks so there's really no point. Also Bright Bright's attack has enough of a telegraph (the shadows) so it doesn't really matter.;No consoles or Mac port stretchgoals?;Hey I got a fatal error crash in the demo of the game. I copied the report that popped up would you like the crash information?;I would add to the suggestions of @Andrea to put stretch goals also at the start. People love to see how we can achieve more stuff.;So....how much would we have to raise to get this game on consoles?;This game looks so good and fun! The promotional art is simply awesome, I would pay good money for a T-shirt! The in-game graphic quality is sometimes inhomogeneous, but I’m sure that will be fixed during the development.
Some suggestions to give this campaign the popularity that deserves:;- 1$ reward
- put the demo on the top of the pitch (more easy to find) and in the campaign sub-title
- Thunderclap buzz
- Fanart Contest!;It would be fabulous!;Also I'd be willing to give a snazzy rock filled suitcase for an art book;this game is amazing, cant wait to see where it goes. noticed others were having the same issues with items, i also had 1 battle stop after an attack, but other than that has been a fun and amazing experience;I've been following Cox for a few months watching Blue Omen develop has been such a treat!!! This game is everything I love!!! ( doesn't hurt I completely love yagiko and jiro );I feel like I've been cheering from the sidelines for a while now, it feels really good to be able to actually contribute to it! Woo! Go Ink and Cox!!!;@PlayerNegative1: To be perfectly honest, it doesn't change much. No matter which of the two characters an enemy targets, the timing and command are the same.;Switch Version?;I just though of something else that may be useful to add: attack indications. With how quick battles are, it'd be nice if there was more of an indication as to which character an enemy will attack. That may help players land counters more easily.

By knowing what you're playing, the app can convert that to MIDI in real-time and enrich your sound in a bunch of different ways. The guitar feels and plays just like normal, start playing and you'll be amazed.  We can only do this with your early support. So we’re taking care of our Kickstarter backers by offering tremendous value at our lowest prices ever [40%+ off]. Just for a limited time to help us get our wider efforts rolling. We’re also throwing in a whole bunch of free loops and rhythms from our ever-expanding library of styles.Along with your Kickstarter reward choice, you'll receive credits for 50 styles or instruments on the OMB app.     No more keeping up with the playback, now the playback follows your lead. And it’s not just a recorded playback. It’s a dynamic, rich and full sound. Like an awesome virtual backup band that follows your every note.  Thanks to our patented capacitive and inductive tech, you can play guitar and hear the piano. Or a violin. Or practically any instrument. Then switch to another instrument. Or loop it and get back to your strumming. You can even leave the guitar sounds in the background while continuing to play something else. It's magical.  And finally, record MIDI from your guitar. So you can use your guitar to compose music with your favorite software.Turning your guitar into a MIDI controller means making the guitar front and center in the lead, shifting the band dynamic into a more modern pacing, and guitarist-lead playing.    There are a few ways we've integrated our tech with guitars: 3 guitars with our tech built-in: 2 acoustic and 1 electric. An upgrade kit for adding OMB to your own guitar. And a pedal for hands-free OMB control.OMB guitars come pre-installed with our technology, so you can use it as a regular guitar or connect to the app to light up your show. Scroll down to our Guitar Lineup section to see more details on our 3 guitars.  The OMB Upgrade Kit is for those guitarists who want to use OMB but love their own guitar too much to play any other. In a matter of 15 minutes, you can add a slew of amazing features to your favorite guitar. OMB's Upgrade Kit works on most electric and acoustic guitars with steel strings. The OMB foot pedal connects to your guitar and app via Bluetooth, enabling you to control almost any feature on the app completely hands-free. Adjustable height, so you can set it at a comfortable angle. for Super useful, whether you're playing for an audience or recording.    The OMB app mainly does 2 things (and it does them exceptionally well):1. In playback mode - It provides you with a variety of styles to choose from in order to back your playing, from rock styles to jazz and country - choose, play with the mix, tempo and enjoy your live band  2. In instrument mode - It lets you solo play on your guitar with any instrument you choose (from piano, synths, brass. violins, drums and more)  In the OMB app you can also program your OMB pedal's 5 buttons to your 5 most used controls.When in playback mode, choose your rhythm and style. Easily select and play with the mix of different instruments in the playback. Choose which instruments to play, how loud, and how long. When in instrument mode, use the app to choose and cycle instruments from our wide selection of different sounds. You can use OMB with the built-in sounds of your device (iOS and Android have some basic MIDI functionality), but we're creating an amazing selection of rhythms, styles, and instruments to complete the OMB experience.Kickstarter backers get 50 styles or instruments for free (the retail version of OMB will come with just 5).           OMB's patented technology is unique in that it utilizes capacitive and inductive tech to detect signals from the strings and convert them to digital data without any latency.Basically, your fingers close a circuit every time a string is pressed against a fret, and OMB records and converts the notes and chords to a MIDI protocol signal, which enables OMB's innovative features.   Installing the OMB Upgrade Kit takes just 15 minutes and can be done by anyone with basic technical skills. If you don't feel comfortable doing it yourself, you can take it down to a hardware or guitar store for the quick service. We've been assured by numerous guitar store chains that they can install it quickly and inexpensively. We'll also send out a list of relevant stores and service providers before or with delivery. It'll come with a detailed guide, and there's a video below, but the basics of it are:  We want to be super transparent, OMB works amazingly well, but it does have a few limitations at this point:              Tross is a data-driven crowdfunding powerhouse.    }","Sun, January 28 2018 9:33 AM EST","{Incredible.

1. Please have a look at Fret Zealot and let me know if it is gonna be a problem... or maybe I can install OMB at the bottom of the neck and Fret Zealot at the top?
2. Any chance whatsoever of you guys eventually letting people buy only the built in form factor?;I wouldn’t normally even consider the pedal option in these scenarios because the product hasn’t proven itself to me but I’m not able to buy the built in and can’t buy a whole guitar just for the built in;Like, I haven’t missed anything here right? How do I get the built in without it coming inside a guitar I don’t want and would rather not butcher? Haha;@Creator;Thanks! But that doesn’t resolve my need for a cutaway guitar... is there any way to buy the built in and install it to a preferred guitar without wasting my money on a type of guitar I don’t want that is just gonna get left with a giant hole?;I mean, I can and will buy both and do that eventually if I have to... but unless you’re telling me I can get a diy inbuilt option I’m gonna wait and see what the kit I pledged for can even do before I butcher two guitars;I mean, I’m creeping up near 20 guitars these days... but yeah haha;oh!!! i forgot it the foot pedal can be a midi foot controller for other apps?;Hello, i bucked 129$ OMB upgrade kit and i want to know if i can buy the foot pedal one year after and how much will be cost it. and an other question will there be more app details? can we add ours midi drums? how many drum rhythm each genre are available? can we make a fill change with foot pedal? thanks!!!;@Michael Morrissey good question, our goal is to release as many options as possible to accommodate as many guitarists as we can. We cannot say just yet how many additional options will be available in September 2018 beyond the 2 advertised today, but you can rest assured we are aiming for a wide range.;@Grayson King and thank you for your support <3;@Grayson King We are just impressed how you can handle all that gear! We advise that you try our built in option so you will have as much room as possible for your other devices. We appreciate your many ideas and you have certainly given us a lot to think about! Thanks for taking part in the discussion Grayson!;My point is I can already do everything the OMB (I think I wrote OBM before haha) can do and more (much more if I code and tie all these loose ends together) by using ACPAD, a laptop or windows surface pro (full windows), an iRig Pro Duo and a Fret Zealot or wired Fretlight;Yet by making my guitar Windows enabled with Ockel’s mad little pc and choosing some kind of interface for it like ACPAD I can take that on the road and not be contained inside my house with bulky anything and even this OMB pedal is a huge drawback to those goals for me as it could be resolved with a Myo Armband around my ankle or similar;I can get the AI band members by booting up Rocksmith or alike but it’ll be worse than what I’ve seen of this product so yay an upgrade there for me haha I can get the loop and recording stuff going very easily, I can engage with ACPAD or an even more powerful option I came up with by making a virtual modular pedalboard controlled by gesture and positional tracking by simply setting up some Myo armbands around my ankles so foot gestures do certain commands without even needing to code anything cos Myo already did it, think left foot moved east = Ctrl alt del = command to swap to ableton live and play loop A, foot north could play loop B or equal command to record it etc;I can get the midi interaction in a tiny form factor with Ghost Midi Pickup Bridge but yet that’s still analog (aka huge bulky pedalboard required) but if only Fishman Tripleplay would hide and connect to the ghost pickup system but no of course not haha;Don’t get me wrong, OMB is worth the money to me especially if I can hijack it or any component to help in my own goals or simply cos designed functions are better than cowboy rigging haha ;);I don’t know what point I’m making I’m just sharing my experience and frustration maybe that’s useful to someone I dunno but I’ve had my rant even though I could go on
| (• ◡•)|;Anyways glad to be here =P;Interactive led lights on the fretboard (not bridge)**;Must have typed too quick or cut and paste some points in editing ;);Grayson’s Dream Guitar/Tech Combo:;I can mention products that show how it is possible already if only everything worked together nicely or one company brought these ideas together but I’ll try to keep it conceptual for now;OBM brings what potential Rocksmith has to the table plus some more things that couldn’t do but if it plays nice with something like Fretlight and/or Fret Zealot (preferred) then I see huge potential beyond what they have so far;I mean, I see the value for OBM on its own I do or I wouldn’t buy it but it’s yet another example in which a MIDI enabled guitar/device doesn’t do out of the packet the most powerful thing it could do: to automatically tab everything you play and build a profile of your playing as well as automatically organise your recorded sessions by analysing the music and tagging it with scale and key info for easy recall;I’ve recorded every second I’ve ever played (started on a shitty Nokia 3300 with 42kbps per minute quality and 1min max recordings and now use Evernote but oh if only Apple Music Memos wasn’t massively held back by iCloud storage prices and so on there’s other issues why I don’t use it) and if you ask me to I can semi-easily listen to that piece from Jan 1st 2011 and listen to my own ranting after the piece is played a few times ‘Fret 14 on E to 15 on A’ to rebuild ANY piece I’ve ever written with a few corrupt files or missing files etc here and there cos hey a bus went past as I explained that one little tricky bit or my phone died etc etc;It happens but it doesn’t have to... in comes technology;I’d kill for a built in audio interface that records the audio from my guitar in full quality but just does it automatically then uploads to Dropbox when I get home and connect my guitar to the internet - and that’s where I get a bit DIY cos iRig Pro Duo could be butchered for this purpose and I can install Ockel Sirius A Pro to give my guitar a fully modular developed brain... the physical options exist just not the software or interactivity framework/infrastructure between all these things;Just my recordings alone have allowed me to understand my own patterns cos I analyse it by accident whenever I record the fretmap to rebuild it but not like machine learning could do or how tech could streamline the whole thing and save me effort whilst being more reliable and accurate and also teaching me more about music as I went by identifying what I just did and correctly labelling and naming it;MIDI has massive potential to make you better simply by watching and listening to what you do then informing you how heavily you utilise certain scales or even how far out you were at 1m42 to 1m55;And yet it is used to make your guitar sound like a piano (great but not the best thing it could do, also not exactly a unique or groundbreaking option) and yet you could trigger loops from a piano piece you actually played and get a really full and rich and true piano sound like ACPAD allows me to do cos I prerecorded it with an actual piano and midi just ain’t up to scratch there yet nor probably ever will be;AI Band Members are great though, or even looping options like OBM has for yourself... fantastic I say chuck it on the pile but can I load in my own MIDI files I recorded on my Clavinova or wrote in a notation software? Or can those AI band members be more like ghosts of myself in which once I hit Fret 9 on A that is the cue to start the sax bit I recorded? I’m actually asking cos it’s not clear to me just how deep down the rabbit hole OBM has gone and yes I know this is ranty as hell ;) ;);I hope it shows excitement at your product and a willingness to engage in the discussion more than anything else... I’m aware of limitations and I know you can’t and won’t change the product at this stage I’m just talking big picture as one inventor to another bunch of inventors hahaha;Ok so my dream guitar records everything ever and keeps it organised... big whoop you might say if you hadn’t understood the potential there or it doesn’t fit with your views... except you can tag that as a great riff or favourite it so it comes back up as you jam at some point down the line cos if you’re playing or just recorded a rhythm piece it could know for a fact that musically speaking that riff from five years ago you loved but forgot can maybe work for this new piece and then it plays and you’re jamming with your past self (let alone playing with others and that’s a huge potential here too in what I’m describing as several instruments enabled with this could interact like crazy);Add in interactive LED lights on the bridge that leaves you able to relearn any piece you’ve ever written very easily as is akin to Guide mode on a Yamaha Clavinova (and already doable but bulky and wired with Fretlight and any Midi Pickup via Guitar Pro so the set up and bulk makes it hard to do and get going with - I have thought about all this a LOT and bought into basically ALL these things I have found) and a database/profile software that can literally show you the riffs that will work perfectly with whatever chords you’re playing from your OWN repertoire by playing the recording whilst overlaying the notes on the fretboard;Nevermind the learning covers potential which is mighty (see Fretlight and Fishman Tripleplay with GT Control on YouTube) you could easily have a discovery mode so you learn as you do... start playing a riff and the guitar neck lights up all frets you’ve already played... don’t know where to take it just scroll through every scale potential from that starting point and visually see it... let’s say played notes are red (or colour coordinated so red is a etc) and the rest of the lights are white until you play them;Now you can know that the riff you played without knowing it happens to be a mixolydian... there’s reverse search key and scale and chord options here and OBM could give you these options on a software side of things albeit up to the 14th fret only for now ;);What this means is interactive Skype style lessons which actually GT Control/Fretlight/Fishman Tripleplay could have done but naw they decided not to even though I told them why that’s madness;A self recording guitar that profiles your ability and can challenge you with things it knows you’ve never done or have an online community and so on, I can go on but I won’t (for now) hahaha;Imagine being able to jam on the bus and then it records everything you did and pulls out a riff from years ago you loved but forgot and that practice session is automatically recorded in a quality that might actually make it into the album you release;Slap a Bluetooth levalier mic into play and now we are talking and that’s what I’m gonna use Senstone for effectively along with quick and easy idea recording;I am not even halfway done but what I’m saying is I’m excited but also once again I see how it won’t do what I want it to do hahaha
¯\_(ツ)_/¯;I really am gonna have to make this thing myself huh? Dammit hahaha;From the FAQ section--> ""We send an additional form to our backers to fill out options like left handed or right handed, as well styles and other options."" I am backing at the electric guitar level. I am cool with the strat style and color you have shown, but this makes me beg to ask, will there be other style and colors available for the electric guitar as production gets under way?;I gotta say it’s a cool device BUT I do have one huge grievance about this campaign and that is the lack of a cutaway acoustic built in option or the ability to buy the built in option and install that ourselves without a guitar with it as I would prefer the built in form factor over the upgrade kit simply because I have other things and devices that need the space the upgrade kit takes up;Or does the upgrade kit HAVE to be right there at the base of the bridge or is there a way to move it out of the way with discreet cables or some way to position it so it just ain’t where it is;Yes I can install this upgrade kit into my own cutaway guitar but therein lies an issue with how compatible it can be with my own unique dream guitar setup as I have an ACPAD already and that can do things yours can’t simply because I’m gonna combine it with an Ockel Sirius A Pro and some other things and kind of mount that to the side of my guitar so I’ve got a full windows enabled guitar set up with a midi interface controller (ACPAD) and so on and I can and probably will go into detail here eventually as you guys seem like you’d be into it but it also helps you tell me how well your device fits into my set up or not ;);So if you look at ACPAD clearly it ain’t gonna play well with OMB upgrade kit simply cos of shared guitar space...;Then let’s take Fret Zealot... it says there is something along the neck that closes the circuit? Does that make it is incompatible or gets in the way of Fret Zealot... I mean I COULD use my old Fretlight I guess as then the neck is already LED lighted (and I have many reasons for wanting this) but that installs along the neck so will they interfere with each other?;For my ideal solution and guitar build I can’t say 14 frets is perfect but hey Fret Zealot is like 15 frets I think anyway whereas Fretlight is all frets but much older now for the wired option I need to use (which has special options no longer possible to make me choose it over their wireless upgrade);I know what’ll happen cos life sucks that way, I will end up with a Fretlight with Fret Zealot installed and OMB upgrade kit off to one side tucking cables away somehow and ACPAD on top... it’s gonna get ugly and bulky fast hahaha;I’m gonna explain my dream guitar to you in my next comment ;);Hi, I ordered the Acoustic guitar pto set. What s the difference between the normal acouctic guitar and the pro?;@E Levin - the bending is definitely on our to do list but will not be a part of the product for now as it requires further development but we are fully aware of it and working to create new functionality for that. Thanks!;Hi!
I noticed that it says that it does not have note bending functionality. That is pretty serious, would it be possible to add the functionality separately by including a pitch bend wheel near the right-hand?;@Martin Fu - Once you are logged in and on the campaign, you will be able to choose any other reward and adjust your pledge to that one.;@Fergus Maximus - It will not change anything. The OMB device has a USB output that actually transfer midi signals to our app and to any computer/keyboard. You can use you BOSS together with the OMB and add a variety of styles and sounds as an additional layer.;You can connect your phone/tablet output to the amp and have it together with the guitar/BOSS;I backed a upgrade kit already and would like to add the pedal. How to change it?;OK I am in. after seeing you can order extra parts to move the pickup around, I am sold. I want to setup 2 guitars, one acoustic and one electric. I think I might have to sell my Roland GR 20 setup now :D . Thanks for offering the extra wiring setups;Hey folks,;I'm keen to know how the signal works - I use a BOSS VE-8 Acoustic singer which generates harmonies based on the chords I play (using what I assume is similar logic to the OMB although obviously the technique is different). If I install the OMB, will this change the send from the guitar to the pedal (and potentially confuse it)?;I have assumed that the OMB somehow hooks into the pickup in the guitar so the signal can be sent to an amp so people can hear the backing sounds. Can you please clarify?;Thanks,
Ferg;@Timothy Low thanks for reaching out! The installation process is the same for acoustic and electric guitars. We designed the OMB upgrade kit with aesthetic and function in mind, the result is a compact and slim device with HUGE capabilities!;@Creator Is the installation for acoustic guitars the same? It the pickup unit that chunky?;Super excited to be backing this amazing project!;@Michael Morrissey Thanks for your support! The app will be released leading up to the product launch in order to provide our users with some time to get acquainted with it.;@Joseph Mckendry the OMB can handle drastic changes in tempo, sorry for the delayed response and thank you for your support!;Looking forward to it. Is there any chance that the app will be available for download before delivery?;Guess that's a no to my earlier question
..;I'm buying either way, but can it adjust to drastic tempo changes?;Thanks @Kurt F - The add-on device has a USB output that connects to your mobile phone / tablet to control the app. In the built-in guitars you have both USB and PL output to connect to an amp or console.;Zuerst: Viel Glück für das Projekt!
Vielleicht habe ich es übersehen, aber mich hätte interessiert, wie das upgrade kit mit dem amp bzw. dem mixer verbunden wird;@JohannesHolmgren, First of all - Thanks!
The answer is yes. The soldering is quite easy and we’ll send detailed instructions. Also - we would have lots of labs worldwide that could do that for you.;First!;I backed the Pro Acoustic with pedal ... will I be able to add an upgrade kit later on?

They're super comfortable, lightweight and breathable. They help keep your feet dry and smelling fresh by wicking away moisture and preventing the growth of odor-causing organisms. They're a responsible choice for people who want to minimize the impact their fashion makes on the environment. At Bohempia, our mission is to reintroduce hemp to the world and highlight how using it can help heal our planet.  After years of working with both textile and shoes, we're combining our passions with the belief that the right way to run a company is to produce goods responsibly. We also make sure that all the people working with Bohempia get the fair and respectful treatment they deserve.         The classic court low-top sneaker from the way back is back, powered by hemp. A variety of colors to match any mood or occasion make it a likely candidate as your go-to shoe.  Inspired by SoCal surf sneakers, this sustainable slip-on is stylish in a laid-back kinda way. Who needs laces?  Famous as a boat shoe, this plimsole sneaker combines a nautical flair with casual fashion. A great match with pin rolled pants in colors to match anything.  The Holata's grown up sibling. The Orasa is a hi-top sneaker that was performance gear back when the NBA had 8-teams. Can be worn while strolling an exhibition or jumping off stages.  Get your adventure on with the Rohan. The lugged outsole provides traction and the high-top cut protects your ankles from rough terrain. Lace them up and hit it!  Great for expeditions of an urban variety, the Milek is our take on a classic boot style. Enjoy the looks of a boot with the comfort of a sneaker.Hemp is one of the world's oldest cultivated crops; it's been grown for almost 10,000 years. For centuries our ancestors used this versatile plant to make rope, oil, paper, and food. Today hemp is also used to make plastic, building materials, medicine and, now, footwear.For many years governments demonized and often criminalized hemp. It stopped being used and was largely forgotten. Today both attitudes and laws have changed. More and more people realize the macro and micro benefits of this super plant. We advocate for the return of hemp to mainstream use as one of humankind's most beneficial and multipurpose crops.  We're inspired by classic footwear silhouettes. From court inspired casual sneakers to rugged urban adventure boots. Timeless styles that are simple, yet refined. Shoes that can be worn with almost any outfit and on any occasion. Footwear classics that we think will become your favorite pair.   We make shoes using vulcanized construction which means they don't need glue or stitching to bond the upper to the outsole. Heat and pressure firmly fuse the upper and the outsole together.Comfort is very important to us. To make sure you have a great experience we use a blended cork-rubber insole that provides excellent cushioning and shock absorption. A special arch cookie gives extra support.  Great shoes and comfort go hand-in-hand. We strive to offer high-quality shoes. We produce our shoes in an independent factory located in Zlin, Czech Republic, a historic shoe-making city. It was once one of Europe's largest footwear centers and the many years of shoemaking experience and tradition live on in our factory partner.  Treating people with respect is core to BOHEMPIA'S belief system. We think it's the only way to run a business. It also means a fair 'living wage' for everyone from our team members to factory employees. We cooperate with Fashion Revolution in their work to bring attention to conditions of fashion industry workers.                                     }","Thu, December 7 2017 11:03 AM EST","{Dear Backers!  ;Last week you helped us choose our first stretch goal.

The response was overwhelming! Home cooks and professional chefs alike just love the knife’s sharpness and durability, and positive reviews poured in. But we had many people asking if we would be introducing other knives as well, so this year we are launching our new Santoku and Paring Knives!As a self-confessed food enthusiast and amateur chef, I wanted to own the very best kitchen knives I could find. And I wanted them to be the cornerstone of my housewares company, Habitat. What I soon learned, though, was that not much has changed in knife-making in over 200 years!Knife manufacturers have tried to address the same problems for centuries. The steel may be too soft, the knives get dull quickly, they need lots of maintenance, and they may react with food. Ceramic knives have problems, too. They can be brittle and break easily.I felt certain there must be a way to move knife-making into the 21st century. My search led me to a remarkable metal alloy initially developed by Caltech and tested by NASA – and later patented. I acquired the rights to use this metal alloy and set about determining how best to use it in making a game-changing chef knife that would reinvent the industry and become the new standard.A kitchen knife’s sharpness is THE most critical attribute – and the knife edge angle is the critical factor that determines sharpness. The harder the material is, the sharper the blade can be made. But in ordinary steel knives, a higher level of hardness also makes the knife harder to maintain, and the edge chips easily. The edge on all three Habitat Kitchen Knives is made from this Caltech and NASA developed metal alloy, which is harder than any steel yet isn’t brittle and resists rust.The hardness of a metal alloy is measured utilizing the Rockwell (HRC) testing standard. VERY expensive knives, costing hundreds of dollars, are made from higher carbon steel that is brittle and can rust. High carbon steel hardness can reach the low 60s on the Rockwell scale. (And it is interesting to note that two other popular and successful crowdfunded knives only have Rockwell hardness in the higher 50s.) The Habitat Kitchen Knives blow away the competition with a 70+ reading on the Rockwell scale!Most importantly, the Habitat Kitchen Knives surpass anything else on the market. They hold their edge better and longer due to the hardness of the metal alloy. And they aren’t brittle because the blade is steel but the edge is the patented metal alloy. The combination of hardness, high elasticity, and corrosion resistance makes the metal alloy edge wear resistant.This superior alloy also allows us to sustain an aggressive angle for our edge of just 12.5 degrees on each side for a total of 25 degrees. (Most knives are manufactured with a combined angle of 30 degrees.) What does this mean? The sharper the angle, the easier and more precise the cut.The Habitat Kitchen Knives are ultra-sharp and last 5 times longer than ordinary knives.The patented metal alloy edge possesses a natural nano-serration at the molecular level. This serration is like microscopic, ultra-hard “teeth” that are what make the effortless and breathtaking cutting power of the Habitat Kitchen Knives possible.Another benefit of this nano-serration is the self-sharpening aspect of the microscopic teeth. As the knife is used, these tiny teeth are exposed and essentially sharpen themselves – and this is part of what allows the Habitat Kitchen Knives to retain their ultimate edge far longer than other knives.It wasn’t enough to just acquire the use of the NASA-tested metal alloy. We needed to develop a process for bonding this metal alloy to the high-quality stainless steel knife blanks that would comprise the Habitat Kitchen Knives. This required the time and effort to perfect the process shown in this video clip.Thanks to the money we raised from last year’s crowdfunding campaign, we were able to perfect this technology and buy additional equipment. Now the process is much faster and more precise, and our production capacity is greatly increased.The patent-pending edge bonding process is what sets the Habitat Kitchen Knives apart as the new standard of excellence. We believe this patented process will revolutionize the knife-making industry.While my Habitat Chef Knife reinvented the category with its revolutionary edge, there are still proven knife features that matter – and I made certain they are included in the design of all the Habitat Kitchen Knives.Here are a few: The Habitat Chef Knife is hands down the most important knife in your collection. At 14.1 inches in total length and 8 inches in blade length, the Habitat Chef Knife has a wider blade than most and is also a bit longer. The reason why this is an advantage to the user is because the wider blade allows for more cutting area, making the knife more efficient and easier to use. The longer blade allows for more precise cuts, and it’s safer compared to smaller chef knives.Another unique attribute of the Habitat Chef Knife is that for its size it is extremely lightweight and easy to maneuver. Unlike with heavier chef knives, you will be able to use the Habitat Chef Knife for long periods of time without feeling fatigue or cramping in your hand.The Habitat Santoku Knife measures 11.7 inches in total length and 7 inches in blade length. I consider this knife to be the workhorse of the group. Combining the features of a cleaver and a chef’s knife, this multipurpose knife minces, dices and slices. I love my chef knife, but I find myself using my Santoku knife just as much around the kitchen simply because it’s so fun to cut with. Having said that, we designed our Santoku knife to be as stylish as it is practical.We have included a Granton edge — those are the dimples you see on the sides of the blade that keep things from sticking to the knife. This helps when cutting items that retain water, such as tomatoes. Our Santoku knife is lightweight and extremely durable, and, along with our chef and paring knives, it really is a must have.The Habitat Paring Knife is just the right size. At 6.33 inches in total length and 3.27 inches in blade length, this indispensable knife is basically a smaller version of the chef knife. It’s best utilized for slicing and mincing items that are too small for the chef knife. The paring knife is perfect for cuts that require precision and attention to detail, such as peeling, trimming and slicing small fruits and vegetables such as strawberries, shallots and garlic, to name a few.The Habitat Paring Knife takes all of our key design attributes into consideration and focuses on delivering the shape and size needed to make every type of cut.This video clip shares some of our design process with you:Other knife-makers talk endlessly about the minor differences between their knives and others. They show pictures and diagrams and go on and on. Yes, these features matter, and I’ve paid close attention to them, too, as you have seen.But these others don’t have anything more important and different to talk about. I do!The sharpness and durability of my superior knife edge will become the GOLD STANDARD for knives.See for Yourself! Below is a chart that shows FIVE important attributes desirable in a quality kitchen knife – sharpness, durability, food safety, food taste, and being corrosion free. See for yourself how the Habitat Kitchen Knives compare to the competition. We aren’t afraid to name names.Another important comparison is price – and we all know price is driven by value. Yes, there are knives that cost less, and there are knives that cost more. In fact, there are kitchen knives costing hundreds of dollars more. But if their cutting edge is not harder (and NONE have a harder edge), then they can’t match the performance of our knife. That means the value of the Habitat Kitchen Knives simply can’t be beat!Who would know better about the performance of kitchen knives than professional chefs? I have placed our prototype knives with a significant number of professional chefs – and the accolades are pouring in! See and hear for yourself what these chefs have to say about the Habitat Kitchen Knives in their own words!        And it’s not just professional chefs who are raving about our Habitat Kitchen Knives, either. Home cooks love them as well! Many have never had the pleasure before of owning a professional-grade knife at a fraction of the cost, but now they can — and so can you! Frankly, I can talk about the great performance of the Habitat Kitchen Knives all day long. But my opinion will never be as persuasive as those of these professional chefs and home cooks. They have all rigorously tested our superior kitchen knives in their restaurants and home kitchens and have shared their honest and candid opinions.There are more than a few “war stories” about Kickstarter projects that have failed to deliver their rewards in even close to a timely manner. I am not proud to admit it, but we did run into some challenges during our previous campaign. We had a terrible experience working with our fulfillment center. This caused some issues, as well as backers changing addresses at the last minute or not replying to the surveys and then sending emails asking us why they hadn't received their knives.....lol....live and learn. Now, having one successful campaign under our belts, we know exactly what to expect and are extremely prepared to deliver what we say when we say we will.  Not only do I want to reward you for backing my project, but I also want to be certain you receive your reward when promised.We are so confident that we’re going to deliver your knives on time and as promised that if we don’t, we’ll refund 100% of your initial pledge.

(i.e. so I am not charged additional shipping?) Please advise, thank you!;@Adam Ackerman;Thank you very much for response Adam,
I will direct some additional questions to the provided email, but maybe these might be beneficial for other so I will try them here:
I am interested in the last step that you use, on the leather strop, to make that amorphous layer. I would say this is importan to understand for potential owners who do like to care about their knives and really work on the edge from time to time. Could you please decribe what is needed for that step? Is it just stroping on a leather or some abrasive compound needed? Can it be done manualy or does it need those higher speeds of motorized machines? Does your Novaculite stone perform that step too or should it be stroped after honing on it? :)
And just to clarify a bit, why I am trying to learn more about how much I can actually polish that edge - its because there are basicaly two types of sharp edge on knives, polished one (where the aim is to make it as smooth and straight as possible - and its a very durable edge when its made) and a micro-serrated one (like a very very small saw toothed edge - does not need so many sharpening steps, but also not that durable). I know both type of edge have their use, but I am very much into the polished razor sharp (shaving) edge. Now - because of how you describe the material, I would guess your edge is somewhat crossing that gap, and being more durable even though it has those micro serrations ... And that is really great, and most people will simply be happy with how long it stays sharp. But it also makes me wonder, if I will be able to make it shaving sharp when I will be sharpening it, because thats what I need to be happy with my sharpening job :D. If this does have a simple unswer of yes, it can be made shaving sharp, or no, it cant ... please let me know. I will either take one set for a friend who does not have this obsession :) or also a second set for me.
And - just to repeat for others reading this to make it clear: since both kinds of edge sharpness are usefull and both help you cut easily, it does not change the quality of the knife if it can be made shaving sharp or not. Its just good to know for those who insist on this style of edge :D I guess these knives will be great! (Just to make a little comparison - since they should be at 70+ HRC - as far as i know the only steel that comes close is a ZDP-189, at 65 - 67 HRC, and knives made out of this special steel are REALY crazy expensive /and also hold their edge for a crazy long time - so I would guess these are going to be even more crazy in that/ ) :D;Once again, Thank you Adam and wish you all the best with your campaign.;Marcus Wu asked;Also does a habital weighing scale come with it?;Answer:;It depends on which pledge level you backed. The holiday delivery does not include the scale. The April delivery does.;Adam;Marcus Wu asked:;Is the $149 Christmas special available as it says 3 days left but then required to fill before the 15th...;Answer:;The Holiday shipping will remain available until we sell out of stock OR the campaign ends. I will have enough time to ship those out. So yes we will honor the Xmas delivery up until the end of the campaign.;Adam;Pavel,;Thank you for such a great question. It was a bit more technical than I am comfortable with, so I connected with my development team at the factory. See response below.;Please email if you have additional questions - support@ gohabitat . com;It sounds like you have a passion and greater understanding so hopefully this is of value. I simply use the Novaculite Stone for sharpening my knives and even though it might not be as technical, it still works great and I have never had an issue. But I hardly ever need to sharpen so maybe that's part of the problem...lol;The special alloy material has several unique features. It is important to remember that this alloy is not a steel. This means you have to experiment with the material and see how it responds to your input.;1. The alloy is a composite of hard abrasives and ductile amorphous matrix. The hard abrasives form the serrated teeth and increase durability.
2. It's also an amorphous alloy, which under certain abrasion transforms its surface to an amorphous layer.;Our internal sharpening procedure is a three step process.;1. Using a rougher grit stone, lightly reshape the bevel. (less than 600 grid is ideal)
2. Using a finer grit stone, sharpen the edge. (1000 or more is sufficient).
3. Leather Strop transforms the surface of the edge to a thin amorphous layer. Hard surface and softer base is the key to increase durability while maintaining ductility.;Our factory sharpening tools are motorized and necessary to meet production schedules. The concept of staring with coarse stones and finishing with finer stones is exactly what is utilized at the factory. The main difference is that the leather strop step performs an unique function of inducing amorphous transformation.;@Adam Ackerman - Hello Adam, I am considering highly pledging for two sets, but I have some questions I need to ask first. Thank you for answering :)
A) Sharpening - I am a hobbyist knife sharpening enthusiast, using mostly large diamond bench stones (up to 5000 grit) and then diamond compound on leather strops for final polishing (up to 0,5 microns) or ceramic bench stone 30000 grit alternatively .... now - how suitable for this polished edge style of sharpening is the edge of Habitat knives? Will it benefit from this sharpening or is there a certain “grain size” of those structures in the edge that make further polishing having no positive effect?
B) I see you have shown a sharpening, or rather honing, stone of a 8000 grit ... BUT ... how about the real sharpening or even reprofiling the edge when needed, can I approach it (with the tools I have) in the normal way - from coarse to fine in incremental steps, or is there something in that process that could damage the edge? (I noticed mentioned that most sharpening methods you tried other than the arkansas stone did hurt the knife in some way, so thats why I am asking )
C) May I ask how much of the edge material is there on the knife? Or how much material can be removed by sharpening to still have your special material on the edge?
D)Might you share a macro úhoto of the edge polished with the 8k stone? I have some idea how regular high qualiity knife would look , but seeing how that special alloy looks polished would help me a lot upon that suitability for polishing stuff.;Also does a habital weighing scale come with it?;Is the $149 Christmas special available as it says 3 days left but then required to fill before the 15th...;You don’t even reply to my questions Creator.;Looking at that last update and the pic of the block, is that knife hiding inside the block our first look at a steak knife. To my eyes the handle looks a little different then the paring knife and it's too small to be the cleaver. Anyways my wife and I enjoy the first knife and are really looking forward to the Santoku since it's a bit smaller and more our style. Only complaint is that we had to buy a new cutting board because the knife is so sharp it chopped our old board up.;Hi, was wondering how thick is the alloy coating you guys apply to the stainless steel knife body? Will there be anything left after I have sharpened it a few times, or would I have grinded away the alloy and exposed the underlying knife body?
Was also trying to find out more about the alloy and stumbled upon this, is this the alloy you are using?

Will a good Norton or King waterstone will work fine with this metal using the appropriate grits?;Answer:;1200 grit novaculite is equal to Norton 8000.;I am very disappointed in this and the former project - firstly I bought the Chef's knife as a new tool for me to use I can never use it because my wife grabs it every time she can and it is never available to me. Secondly this new project comes along with some fancy new knives and then they load me up with a desire for more things that complements my existing things. It's disgraceful!

Will a good Norton or King waterstone will work fine with this metal using the appropriate grits?;Creative says:;Wow!;Not only a wonderful update but exciting!! Super!
Any sense of what the sharpening stone will run?
And will the cleaver be more for slicing or is the edge going to be angled enough to chop through large bones?
Finally, the bock looks great - but given its narrowness, would it not tip easily? It is beautiful though.;Reply:;Hello Creative....I remember having a dialogue with you before. Thank you for the kind words.;The whetstone will run around $39 ish I am guessing - working out the final details now.

Anyway to put those dollars towards other items I plan to purchase?;Reply:;brocalreps, Thank you for the support - I am grateful. Unfortunately there is not a way to repurpose those dollars to the other products. The scale is a bonus specifically for this campaign and those knives. The additional items have other costs that eat into our ability to do to. Shipping, Minimum order quantities, etc;Hopefully that makes sense.

The Nimbatus can’t wait to start its engines and burst off into the vastness of space and into adventure.
But what is a ship without a crew? Join our crew and get ready for an exciting journey!

Nimbatus is a space-game in which you build physically simulated drones out of hundreds of different parts and solve missions in a huge procedurally generated universe filled with fully destructible planets and vicious enemies. In an online mode you compare your creations with other players from all around the world and compete in a wide array of diverse challenges.     
The vision behind Nimbatus - The Space Drone Constructor is to build a tool that let's players come up with all kinds of crazy drone designs, big or small, quick or robust, automated or self-controlled. After creating with a presumably perfect design, players can test their creations in various kinds of missions and compare their results with others.

Features:      To get a first impression of Nimbatus, check out this quick gameplay intro:We plan to strongly involve the game's community to decide what other features are added during the Alpha testing phase and on Steam Early Access.

Nimbatus - The Space Drone Constructor is developed by Stray Fawn Studio, a small indie studio based in Zurich, Switzerland. Our focus are procedurally generated entertainment games, which hold educational value. Our studio's genre focus are simulation and strategy games. We recently released our first game, Niche - a genetics survival game on Steam and GOG. Niche was also funded via Kickstarter.  Nimbatus started out as a hobby project with the goal to combine the spacecraft building aspect of Kerbal Space Program with the destructible terrain of Minecraft. Over the last years it has evolved and changed quite a lot and was also inspired by great games like Reassembly, Faster Than Light and Besiege.Type: Single Player with asynchronous multiplayer features

We will surely reach the goal in the next few days. We are super close.;@Stray Fawn Studio
Thanks for updating!
Just to be sure - what do we have to do for a forum join to count towards the community goal of Nimbatus? I thought just joining the forum would be enough...;This game is amazing!!! Can't wait to see where this goes!;I'm loving the game so far, but the weapons really need to be sortable. Like, assign tags for ""rocket"", ""shotgun"", ""tower"", ""EMP"", etc. so when we need a specific kind of weapon, we can find it.;Also, sorting in secondary elements couldn't hurt. I.e.: ""rocket"" ""tower"" sort by ""damage"". Just for us hoarders who like to hold on to all the loot until we can figure out what isn't worth holding on to.;@selune Sorry for the delay we have updated the goals today!
The majority of our forum members are coming from our other game Niche where we started collecting community suggestions. We still need some more for Nimbatus to reach the goal :);Are you no longer updating the community goals? The Facebook post has more than 100 shares by now and your forum members almost doubled since the start of the campaign...;@djtrickym The steam release date was updated. The Alpha will start in January / February and the steam early access release will be a few months later in Q2 2018.;If the Drone engineer is not taken by the end, I will take it. It would be cool if you could explain more about drone designing thing.;so the alpha says Q1 2018...yet steam says release date is Q1 2018 as well?? when exactly is the alpha for the backers, and when is Early Access on steam?;I don't usually support games on kickstarter, but the demo really changed my mind. It is an excellent proof of concept and I look forward to seeing how you guys expand on it.;Love the game, it's so much fun to build drones! Making a demo was a great idea! I'm usually really bad at these ""design your ship"" type of games, but for some I got Nimbatus's system down.;Saw Lathland playing this on his YouTube channel and had to back it! Looks right up my alley! �;Love the stretch goals so much!;@yoyo421 Only one, but you get the key earlier to participate in the Alpha :)
All backers get an additional key if we reach 5 community stretchgoals.;@Stray Fawn Studio Do the 38CHF get 2 copies of the game or just one?;@Some1 We currently plan to release the game on steam, but without DRM. You will however need a steam account to download the game.
If we decide to release the game on other stores like GOG or Humble later, we will give the backers the choice to switch.;@Xartain You will get the keys for the other games as soon as the kickstarter is finished. Maybe 1-2 days later because we have to make a list of all the people who get the keys :);The Nimbatus Alpha starts next January / February, you will get the key by then.;@Von Stray Fawn Studio: Is the game DRM free, or will there be a DRM free version (GOG, Humble) available? (This would be an useful entry in the FAQ section.);@Stray Fawn Studio do we get the 47CHF game keys on the 5.12 or later? i`m in need of Avarion :D;Its really refreshing to see that there are swiss games being developed. Im hyped for Nimbatus.;Also a switch release would be the last thing i need to convince myself to buy a switch. well this and retimed.;viil erfolg :);I've never backed anything until now, this was absolutely worth the CHF47!;Reassembly is one of my favourite games of all time, so excited to see what Nimbatus will bring!;@Rocco Balsamo Thanks :) Currently we wan't the demo only on our website.
@Kevin Beck Thats what we thought too! Thats why we added Drone Sharing as the next stretch goal!;Playing the demo and absolutely loving it. I got one laser that I really like except for its reflecting property making it rather unpredictable. I don't know if this is already going to be in the final game, but a way to add/remove attributes from a weapon would be awesome for those times when you find something that's just almost perfect.;Assuming that the game will eventually be on steam, I'd love to see a steam workshop where you can share and download other peoples drones!;Looks awesome. Any interest in sharing a demo at my site https://simmer.io? You can also embed web demos in KS. Let me know if you want details!;@ Minh Nguyen : Interesting book, will check it out;I was also thinking this would be perfect for a port to the Switch one day. But for now makes total sense to just focus on the PC version =);Saw this game played by Etalyx on youtube (thanks Etalyx!) and immediately had to come back your project. I'm not a wealthy man, quite the opposite actually, but the demo alone looked awesome so I just had to. I love space games, I love ship building, and I love the idea of programming a drone with building blocks.;Really looking forward to the alpha, and congratulations on hitting your Kickstarter goal!;@Robert Chu We currently don't have plans for a console release. Wether we do it or not will depend on how successful the game is on PC and if it's fun without a keyboard and mouse :);I'm doubtful but curious: are there any plans for release on the Nintendo Switch?;This idea is so awesome! Happy to back and looking forward to the Alpha =);Well done for the goal !
wait to se what you can do with more stretch goals and can't wait to touch the alpha version;Best regards;So excited for this game. It reminds me of this book series called ""We Are Legion (We Are Bob)"" - it involves exploring the universe, as well as, destroying planets. Totally recommend checking out the book.;Synopsis:
""(Bob) has been uploaded into computer hardware and is slated to be the controlling AI in an interstellar probe looking for habitable planets. The stakes are high: no less than the first claim to entire worlds. If he declines the honor, he'll be switched off, and they'll try again with someone else. If he accepts, he becomes a prime target. There are at least three other countries trying to get their own probes launched first, and they play dirty.;The safest place for Bob is in space, heading away from Earth at top speed. Or so he thinks. Because the universe is full of nasties, and trespassers make them mad - very mad."";@Nicole Jasaitis Thanks :D Yes you will get steam keys when it's released on steam early access. The engine mechanic and higher tiers will get Alpha access before it's sold on steam.;Nice job on getting fully funded! Will backers get codes for use on Steam when the game is released?;Just saw a post on Reddit about this. Seems super interesting. Reminds me of a mix of KSP and some old style flash builder games but much more in depth and well animated. Can't wait for full release!;Congratulations on reaching 100% funding!
The demo was really up my alley, looking forward on future updates.;@US Claire Force Yes we will add achievements and trading cards for the full release. During the early access we will totally focus on the gameplay.;Interesting game you have here! If released on Steam, will it support achievements and trading cards?;@Hayley If you like to activate the same thruster when you press W and D, you can add an OR-Logic parts and set the W and D keys as input and the U key as output. You now can set the thruster to use the U key and it will activate when you press W, D or U. Hope this helps :);Ooh, a switch does it work that way?;Ooooh, cool. So I have 4 diagonal thrusters, from upper left clockwise, a b c d. And I want a and b to activate when I press w for up, bc when d for right and so on.;So the item reacts differently under a different command. Is that possible?;@Michael Jan B. Busi Sounds fun :D We are pretty open to suggestions like this, we will let the players vote for the features they like best!;I am loving the sheer creative freedom Nimbatus offers! Definitely my favorite thing to do is have two separate auto-balance drones, one mapped to WASD and the other to the arrow keys. That way I don't have one massive clunker to do everything. Are there future plans for such micromanaging support?;@Hayley Yes you can assign the same key to multiple parts. If you like one part to react to multiple keys you can use the OR-Logic part to do this :);Starborn Anarkist is a great game, you should definitely check it out! Yours looks like an upgraded version of it. Best of luck with the campaign.;Hi, I’m playing the demo, and is there a way to have one input activate multiple outputs? If not, can that be possible?;@Jeroen Lambertyn I've never played Starborn Anarkist, but it looks super cool!;}","$20,323",28,57110.45,"Zurich, Switzerland",168,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/strayfawnstudio/nimbatus-the-space-drone-constructor,18,"{Frequently Asked Questions

Lovecraft's stories. We love food. We can't really stop the compulsion to make egregious puns. It's a form of insanity...which is perfectly appropriate for fans of Lovecraft's work. We had this crazy idea... We're gonna make a Cookbook of recipes based on Lovecraft stories, creatures, and characters, as well as whatever else we thought was relevant (cool/funny/groan-worthy). BUT THEN, above all - the recipes that we chose had to taste good!  ALSO as a bonus we wanted the Cookbook to look like the prototypical spellbook of incantations and summonings much like the  Necronomicons (Necronomici? No, no - now it sounds Italian...) found in stories and movies like ""The Evil Dead"" {TM/copyright/legal stuff - Hi don't sue us!}. And we succeeded! These are some damnably good looking and tasting recipe's and meals in here. Let us teach you the rituals. You can sacrifice some hard-earned currency to summon forth this Tome of Forbidden Victuals. Together, let us bring into existence... The NECRONOMNOMNOM!  Unlock it's secrets, and call forth dishes that will destroy your hunger and flay your taste buds - in the good way. Tell your friends!So, what else would we need to create this guide to gastro-intestinal happiness? How about...an acclaimed artist, to scribe our journalicious madness? How about freakin' KURT KOMODA?!? Yes, you will see approximately 100 ORIGINAL(for-this-project) works of art!  His artwork has been featured in several popular game supplements and projects such as The Firefly Role Playing Game, Middarmark, by Luke Crane, Fate Core System and Books by Fred Hicks/Evil Hat Productions. Kurt's  fine works were showcased recently at the NecronomiCON Providence - ARS Necronomica (The H.P.Lovecraft Convention this past August). As a bonus Kurt loves to draw some seriously incredible H.P. Lovecraft monsters. Check out the sample art! http://kurt-komoda.blogspot.com/ Online Portfolio http://www.agonyagogo.com/portfolio/  DeviantArt http://ticklemecthulhu.deviantart.com Flickr http://www.flickr.com/photos/komoda/ ___________________________________________________________  Final versions of the covers and Deluxe covers will be coming soon. The current renderings may not convey the final 9""x12"" size.___________________________________________________________The Book will be a hardcover 9"" x 12"" Tome, upwards to 100 full pages with heavy natural paper professionally bound and lovingly detailed for the look of an archetypal book of spells and rituals. Each recipe will be artistically shown and detailed on its first page with the preparation/instructions on the following page(s). Color tiles of the completed recipes may be included at the end of the book (so we don't ruin the overall look of the book but to allow you to see what the recipes can look like when prepared) depending on funding levels. The Color tiles are available currently to backers in digital format. Deluxe versions of the book will have a hand-crafted latex covers created by our practitioner of the ancient Pirklean arts - Mr. David Pirkle.We have all of our recipes ready to go, we just need our artwork and that will take time (see below).

Yes, due to page count constraints or some other logistical concern. Now imagine an over-sized 9"" x 12"" hardcover book full of these...'cause there are at least 42 more recipes to explore. Each recipe contains its picture and summoning which are usually 2 pages.

Shipping will be based on the actual costs incurred to ship. 

Funds will be collected via the pledge manager after the campaign concludes and the product is ready.

The below are estimates for international for shipping based on a 2lb weight and 9”x12”x1.5” size (the final product could weigh a bit less, or more...it doesn't exist yet, so...you know how this goes). These rates do not cover VAT taxes and other fees. These fees will be determined after end of the campaign, and based on your information/location. We will be using a fulfilment service, and availability of shipping, and pricing, will be dependent on the service. We’ll have an estimator and shipping map up as soon as possible. Backers ordering physical products should be aware that some parts of the world are just not shipping-friendly. If a professional fulfillment company can’t get it there - we sure can’t. While we’d like to have anyone interested be a backer - we have to have a service willing to get a physical product to you. If you know you are in such an area, please limit your pledge to the digital-only offering. US - $10 , Canada - $17, Mexico - $18, Europe - $21-26, Brazil - $18 Australia - $28-$35, Asia - $28-$40(note-within-a-note - we think these are on the high side)Other regions will depend on backer information. The above estimates are subject to change pending final weights, dimensions and backer information. Fulfillment all depends on the shipping company and publisher. If all goes smoothly, you can expect the book in your hands (or inbox for digital purchases) approximately 6 months from the end of the Kickstarter. We’ll keep you updated, and appreciate your interest, support, and patience.  #1 - $35,000 USD - READ THE BOOK OUT LOUD!  - Free Audio Book VersionAll Dreamland Denizens and above pledge levels get a professionally read downloadable version of the book!

He also recently illustrated all of the cabinet and playfield art for The Pinball Company's Jetsons pinball machine! Jon lives in Manchester Center, Vermont.Alec has been self-publishing his Ignatz Award-winning minicomic Phase 7 since 2002, and has released 23 issues to date, which have been collected into six books. He has illustrated a t-shirt and tour posters for Weezer and a chapter book for James Patterson. His graphic novel Basewood was self-published using funds from a successful 2013 Kickstarter campaign! Alec lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico.In 2010, Jon and Alec became obsessed with pinball. They took this energy and channelled it into a self-published, illustrated zine, Drop Target. Over the next five years Jon and Alec put out seven issues, which each centered around a theme: Introduction, D.I.Y., Classics, Moves, Community, Design and Future.Each issue contains a number of Drop Target's regular features:The Drop Target Omnibus will bring together all seven issues of the Drop Target zine, as well as 100+ pages of bonus material, including new comics, illustrations, Dream Machines, interviews and more!The Drop Target Omnibus will be printed in the USA, using print-on-demand technology. Jon and Alec have already printed up two rounds of proof copies, checking their work and making corrections as they go. They are currently finalizing the last few pages of content and doing proofreading passes to catch mistakes, add notes in the back of the book, and to create an index. The goal is to mail out the finished books before the end of the year (2017).The 538-page book will have a cover price of $29.99 for the general public, but it is being offered for $20 to the ""early-bird"" Kickstarter backers, who, it seems very likely, will mostly be old fans of the zine!As a special incentive, Jon and Alec are also offering a limited-edition, screen printed, wraparound dust jacket, which doubles as a pinball poster. These handmade items are limited to one per backer!Orders in the USA will be mailed via USPS Media Mail with a tracking number. Orders to Canada and other international destinations will be sent First Class International with a tracking number. It is a heavy book (2.2 pounds / 0.96 kilograms), so it is expensive to ship! If only the USPS offered an international book rate....If the international shipping rates are prohibitively expensive for you, please wait until the Kickstarter is wrapped up (in early 2018) at which point the book will be released to the general public including distribution to many of Amazon.com's international platforms, including: Canada, England, France, Germany, Japan, etc. etc. etc.  The book will cost a full $30 USD at that point, but it will be printed and shipped locally at a much more reasonable domestic shipping rate.The Drop Target Omnibus will be the first book published under Jon and Alec's new pinball publishing company, Drop Target Publishing. Their goal for this Kickstarter campaign is to cover start-up costs, and to print 100 copies of the Drop Target Omnibus for Jon and Alec to sell at future shows.Any additional funds that are generated after all printing and shipping expenses have been covered will be split proportionally between the contributors to the Drop Target Omnibus, including those who are listed below!Jon and Alec have plans for a handful of future pinball publishing projects, so getting the Drop Target Omnibus out into the world will also help pave the way for those projects.Below you can see a budget breakdown for our $2,870 fundraising goal.  This will cover our start-up costs, paying the contributors for new content and/or the right to reprint their work from the zines, and the printing and shipping of the first 100 copies.If these initial costs are covered, the necessary funds generated by additional books sales (more shipping materials, more screen printing materials, more Kickstarter fees, etc.) will all be covered by the profit margins built into the price point of the book.  The hope is that this budget model will scale well as the number of backers increases.Thanks so much for checking out this Kickstarter and for sharing it with your friends!  Jon and Alec hope it will allow them to share their love of pinball with a lot of new readers!

You and your friends survived the plane crash, but will you survive the night? Work together to forage for food, craft a fire, and build shelters, but be wary: every step you take in the ravine could be one step closer to madness.We're an all-star team of game-makers and creatives whose first release, Spaceteam, raised $200k in preorders on Kickstarter in 30 days. Spaceteam now sits on lists like ""Best New Board Games of the Year"" by Popular Mechanics and one of the ""Best Board Games of All Time"" by The Daily Dot.Now we're back and ready to do it all over again with our second card game, Ravine. If you like the idea of surviving in the wilderness, eating food you foraged and occasionally going a bit crazy, Ravine might just be your next go-to party game.          As the game stands now, there are 192 cards, 36 small wood tokens, and 1 large wood token. Worry not, neat freaks - the packaging will support an additional expansion in the box. The expansion will include up to 56 cards and will come in a standard playing card tuck box. Like our previous game, we will continue to use the best materials available. For Ravine, we'll be using 310 gsm card stock, which is casino-quality and very durable. The packaging will be sturdy and of a quality worthy of display in your current game collection.           The ArtAt its core, Ravine is an adventure story. For inspiration, we looked to the illustrations that prefaced the chapters of classic adventure novels from our childhood. Once we chose the most common elements someone might discover if marooned in a Ravine environment, we started sketching. Our sketches helped us imagine the world Ravine would live in - a dark and dangerous world tinged with fear and madness. We finalized our illustrations with a few simple textures and natural, muted colors. The OriginRavine started as a university project in a CU Boulder game mechanics course. As a final project, students were challenged to develop a basic game prototype in a two-week sprint. The game was a hit, and became a staple at a weekly ""Gaming Lunch"" held between friends at a pub in downtown Boulder (it's not as nerdy as it sounds; we drink beer, play games, and occasionally talk game mechanics). A few months and many beers later, the project grew into a passion and a plan to take this game to the masses.   }","Thu, December 7 2017 7:35 AM EST","{Hey Islanders:;The holidays are quickly approaching and our favorite day of gratitude and food is only a few days away!

With a few extra cards.
Lets do it people
The 250. Come On !!!;We just made the 200k stretch ! Given the quite constant increase of about 5 k per day I had expected us to reach this level sometime tomorrow, so being there now is good news !
The 250k stretch might be overstretched but let’s hope for an acceleration towards the finals !;I would love a SG that could reduce the shipping; way more than a draw-string bag.;I love that the game is done and not in need of upgrades or additional stuff. I love that it is already complete as envisioned by its creators.;So when you forage, you are actually doing it one card at time until you decided to stop or you are stopped by the forage card?;@Big Tom Casual - We may tease a bit more, but the plan was always to keep it mysterious.;@Carly Wagner Getting attacked by a moose only effects that player who picked up the card. They can only defend against it if they have that item in their hand when it occurs.;@Karl You'll have the ability to add on expansions post campaign.;@Bente - Currently you craft fire, spears, basket, and shelters.;@Jon Kilmek;1) You can, however if you don't find any food while foraging, you die in the woods
2) Yes, just shuffle the discarded cards and play from there. However, this doesn't happen very often in the core game.
3) If there is an 'Uh-oh' card, it applies immediately before you can eat/craft etc.
4) That was actually just for visual effect, you don't actually split up your hearts. Good catch though!;@Julia Chan - Yes, you can do this in the post campaign add-ons;Is it possible to pledge for Ravine + Ravine Expansion + Spaceteam (without the Spaceteam expansion)?;A few rules questions:
1). When you have one heart, you can't forage anymore right? Is there any way around that? We had a few games that ended up with all of us on 1 heart and we just have to hope we can suffer through the rest of the night cards and going mad every night.
2). When the forage deck is exhausted do we shuffle the discard back in or is the Island depleted?
3). If you forage for more than one, do you get to chose the order in which they apply? Specifically if I draw a moose card and a food card, can I eat the food in order to survive the moose attack? If I forage a wood and a stone and a moose, can I craft a spear to fight off the moose?
4). The video seems to indicate that when you die your heart tokens go to other survivors, but I don't see anything in the rules about that.;I Would love This game to move abit
Come On people
Lets get it done.;Does anyone know if there will be more things to craft apart from spear, basket and shelter in the full game? :);I have two Spaceteam games and I am interested in perhaps adding on to get the expansion. How much would it cost to add on each one, or do I need to wait for the pledge manager at the end of the campaign?;@Mathew thanks!;Another question, when being attacked by the moose in the forage stage, does only that person loose two hearts?;Also if not can they be split up between the players?;Can another player defend that person from the moose if you have that flare gun or spear.;@creator Thank you the future cleaning up of the rules! Look forward to playing the game when it arrives.;Looks great! Can't wait to receive it;I'm tempted to pledge further to include the expansion but not because of the 9 player possibilities (i would struggle on that front) but because of the other stuff....;More info !!;Also, the game+expansion has 3 times the backers than just the game does. So I dont think they are lacking a pitch. But sure, you may convince some of the remaining few to upgrade with more explanation.;The 9 players with expansion is what sold me on it. (Bigger groups are always fun);@ creator
Matt, I have pledged for the full package , I’m a believer without having seen the details of the expansion. However, I tend to agree with the suggestion that providing some more detail on the expansion content might help convince many backers to increase the level of their pledge, including the expansion where they had not considered doing so before. Is that something you see possible ?;Want to reiterate again how excited I am for this! The more I game with non-gamers the more I wish this was already on my shelf!;""@Daniel Tasayco The expansion will revolve around the spirits of Ravine, and will introduce a new mechanic to the game."";Will this be expanded upon and with more tangible details and images before the end of the campaign for people currently on the fence about the expansion's value?;Sorry for the delay, I was spending a bit of time with family in Massachusetts. Here are some answers for you all:;@Bente You should all flip heart tokens at once if you're going to forage, everyone draws cards, and then everyone flips cards together to see what you found.;@LocksmithArmy If you lose all your hearts at any point in the game, you're out.;@Marco van Barneveld Yes, you'll be able to purchase more units as well as a few other things. They'll be the same price as the Kickstarter ($25 for Ravine, $21 for Spaceteam);@Karl Hedstrom Things will be a bit clearer than they are in the PnP for sure.;@Daniel Tasayco The expansion will revolve around the spirits of Ravine, and will introduce a new mechanic to the game.;@Carly Wagner That's correct, you wouldn't be able to forage while blind or when you can't move.;@Massimiliano della Rovere Yes, you'll be able to add more expansions in the post campaign add-ons.;@Craig S Kennedy We'll have a custom Wreckage card with your name on it. Currently there are 9 Wreckage Cards that come with the game.;Love the idea
But please be more aktive;@creator could you please be more active in the comments section? There are a lot of good questions being asked without response.;Can anyone explain the 100K stretch goal to me? Is this an option we all get at the end?;I pledged for both ravine + expansion and spaceteam + 1 expansion. Is it possible to receive both the triangulum and the nsfs expansions paying more?;When the madness cards or the mushroom cards that say, your blind or can't use your hands does that mean the next day you can go ""foraging"" due to not being able to see or use your hands?;I printed the PnP to taste the 2p mode, but we lost on the single game that we had time for. Now that I read the draft rules (found on FAQ), Madness cards only activate when losing hearts at NIGHT.;@creator, I hope we have more info on the exp contents. I’m intrigued as any other backer surely are;@marco van Barneveld: awesome, then i will just give a shot. Gonna change my pledge to the bundle pack. Thank you !;Whats that app ????;It's like a physical copy of the app ""Survive"" (as I'm sure others before me have mentioned)! I'm excited about the idea to play this type of game with other people and not just by myself on my phone.;@Karl Hedstrom I can totally understand your post; e. g. we played the pnp again yesterday and I have noticed that the rules just say that all players can forage and will do this at the same time. This is a little obscure, since we changed our strategy depending on what one player found while foraging concering how many hearts you spend or if you eat those berries right now...;But I think it is ok for the PnP - there is plenty of time to refine the rules for the finished game (if intended);I am a little worried about some of the open rule interpretations in certain game situations. I know the creators seem to favor that players come to their own conclusions, this really reduces the fun of the game as you spend more time arguing about rules rather playing the game. I hope the final rules will clarify some of the questions that have been asked in these comments. At least I hope they will answer rules questions on boardgamegeek.com.;@creator:
Will there be the option to buy more copies of SpaceTeam and expansions after the campaign in a Pledge Manager?
And if so, at what price?;@Eric Law:
SpaceTeam is definitely worth it. You can download the free app the understand the theme and get the feel of the fun “chaos” it creates.
imo, the card game is even better.;I host a weekly game-night at my FLGS and have brought my own copy a few times; a big hit every time :-)
(Hence my next post ;-);According tot the universal theorem of the exponential last five days curve, we should reach the 250k mark hours before deadline. Level up your pledges and put your faith in expansion decks !
:-);But what about competitive?
Competitive looks fun,
I want it!;According to trusted sources, historical trends, higher mathematics and university grade forecasting techniques , we should reach the 200K stretch in exactly one week from now....
Unless hell breaks loose on Treetop airlines, our heart tokens will be safe and protected in a cotton drawstring bag ! :-);Pledged ravine + expansion. anyone tried space team ? is it worth it ?;Just had a really fun thanksgiving with family, played some wonderful light games, and I KEPT coming back to, “boy I really wish I had Ravine already.’;I think this is going to be a big big hit;when reading the rules I noticed that they state any time someones heats reach zero they are out. But that is under the nighttime section. So I took it to mean that death only happens at night. So if you return from the moose with food and can heal before night time, you are ok...;That may not be an accurate interpretation BUT its how I handled issues like yours.;Question for gameplay here concering foraging: If you decide to spend multiple hearts and therefore draw multiple cards, is it recommended that you draw them one by one? We had a situation where I had 2 hearts and drew 3 cards. One card was the moose (taking two hearts). In which order do I play the foraging cards, as it is not allowed to eat food to protect you from an animal attack?;@Two Player game: +1 to @LocksmithArmy's answer. Works fine, more risky.;I think it was a wise move to release a PnP! Played it two times in a row with my gf and decided to back this! Looking forward to the final game :);Love it
Come On people;Backed! Kinda feels like it needs more madness cards though?;40k left to go. Gonna rock these sgs;@LocksmithArmy: thanks mate for sharing that extra printable file! Looking forward to playing with 4 players.;42k for next stretch goal.. Hell yeah. Killing it. Keep spreading the word;For competitive play , we've been playing ""last one standing after the game is over (7,10, or 13 rounds)"";Really hope we hit the final stretch...

stretch goals, and the next is well on its way! (Australian Dollars btw). There's a bigger list at the bottom - check it outFirstly I hope you're well and that by the end of this we'll know each other pretty well :)I'm Cat, an oil painter, ex-video game executive producer and I'm f*cking obsessed with the universe. This year I've spent thousands of hours hand-painting images of the universe. Along with my good friend Brenton, we've been working tirelessly to develop a groundbreaking 3D glow print technology, which has turned out some really mind-blowing results.We're so excited to finally bring this project to you!If you're curious to see how I run campaigns, the best way is to check out the comments section on the last years Kickstarter :) This project is really simple - You pick what material you like (canvas, fine-art paper, or custom commission) and how many artworks you like.Then at the end, using our fully-integrated backer kit survey, you'll be able to pick and choose from any of the avaliable designs.Our Backer kit survey even means you can even add on extra prints once the Kickstarter is over too. There are lots of artworks to choose from. Fortunately you don't have to decide right away.The images of the paintings below show both the daytime colour and the night time glow-in-the-dark representations. If you'd like to see more images click the link at the bottom below all of the artwork. :) But wait there's more... ok last section I promise...Each piece comes with its own detailed backstory, filled with interesting facts and special information about what it represents. Along with each print, you'll also receive an authenticity certificate and a detailed booklet with helpful care instructions and a framing guide. Like to see more images of the artwork? click the link above Original paintings are rarely entirely smooth - they often have areas of texture in them which is quite fundamental to the art piece. In normal fine art prints, this information is entirely lost. The reward prints we're creating (shown below) use a revolutionary 3D glow print technology which allows you to physically feel the brush strokes. They also use one of the brightest industrial-strength phosphorescent pigments available on the market, glowing for up to 8 hours. These are real museum grade fine art prints. This means they are: There are quite a few rewards so here's a quick rundown to help you decide. AU$1 - Hold My Place

AU$6930 - COMMISSION ORIGINAL Artwork (~6'5"" x 4'9"" | 150cm x 150cm)
AU$12930 - COMMISSION ORIGINAL Artwork (~9'8"" x 6'5"" | 300cm x 200cm)Each year I use some of the funds from the project to do something more than just provide cool & inspirational space artwork.This year, the plan is to surprise the team at Space X by presenting them with a massive spiral galaxy oil painting with the title ""dream big"" along with a backer recognition plaque that has the names of all the backers physically engraved into it.Honestly, I've been a huge fan of SpaceX for ages and this is something I've always wanted to do. It seems crazy bananas that it could even happen.I've already invested hundreds of hours to creating this art piece so far and all going well, this project will be funding the shipping of this completed mammoth 13ft (4m) wide painting from here in Sydney Australia, to the team at SpaceX in LA, USA.I know what you're thinking... What the H, is fine-art cotton rag vellum? In the arts industry, its simply known as the best fine art paper in the world. These style of prints are commonly framed in a glass frame.Our rag vellum is a luxurious 310gsm fine art paper made from 100% cotton by Breathing Colour and it is highly rated by the Fine Arts Trade Guild for its stability, amazing brightness, and its life expectancy performance (rated at 80+ archival years)As for the sizes - this year, to make the process of framing easier, we've opted to go for standard framing sizes for the cotton rag prints on all designs excluding the long artworks (these you will need to get a special frame because of their dimensions).This means for most of the artworks you can pick up a ready-made frame from a store instead of having to spend lots on a custom made frame - WINNING!For Rag Prints (including border):If the artwork you like is long, your print will be 13"" x 31"" | 33cm x 78.5cm
If the artwork you like is rectangular, your print will be 24"" x 16"" | 59 x 42cm (A2)
If the artwork you like is square, your print will be 20"" x 20"" | 55.5cm x 55.5cmHuge Rag prints that have some serious impact! The same luxurious Rag vellum fine-art quality on a huge scale.For Mega XXL Rag Prints (including border):If the artwork you like is long, your print will be 55"" x 22"" | 139.5cm x 55.5cm
If the artwork you like is rectangular, your print will be 44"" x 34"" | 115.5 x 86cm (A2)
If the artwork you like is square, your print will be 38"" x 38"" | 96.5cm x 96.5cmWhilst I have sized the rectangualr print to fit into a starndard poster sized frame, it is worth noting that prints this size may need a proffesional framer.We are using the finest 100% cotton canvas, The media has a brilliant white point and has specialist coatings to ensure the longevity of your artwork. All canvases are delivered ready to stretch with an extra 2.5"" (7cm) border on each edge to create a gallery wrap and we're also including specialist corner markers to ensure it can be perfectly stretched over a frame.For Canvas Prints: 
If the artwork you like is long, your print will be 47.5"" x 19"" | 120m x 48cm
If the artwork you like is rectangular, your print will be 35"" x 25"" | 89 x 63cm
If the artwork you like is square, your print will be 30"" x 30"" | 76cm x 76cmAs well as the reproductions, you can order your own custom commission piece.This is where you get a unique hand painted artwork which is made to your specifications, made with the finest handmade oil paints on a Belgian linen canvas that has been triple primed with a crushed marble ultra black base.These pieces are take months of meticulous work to produce and are 100% animal product free.As it turns out, some of the best pieces I produced last year were for commissions and we've completed over 20 originals in that time.The process is seriously simple:**Want a different size than what is avaliable? Message me and we can work it out.It's an expensive time of year, so if you're not ready to commit yet / don't have funds ready before the holidays or that special occasion, we have that covered...  The $1 hold my place reward means you can hold your place on the project, and it will allow you to add on the rewards you want up to 3 months after the project has ended. (heads up - orders made in this way will also arrive later too).So you know - once the Kickstarter project has ended, if you haven't joined in with at least the $1 hold my place reward, you won't be able to access these limited edition prints in this format ever again (they really are limited editions)We can deliver to 237 different countries - ie. pretty much everywhere in the world from Antarctica to Zimbabwe. A full list will be avaliable in the FAQ.All rewards are shipped with tracking, so you will be able to keep an eye on their location. After delivering thousands of prints last year, we're comfortably old hat at it now.Prior to postage, all canvas and rag prints are carefully wrapped in special acid free tissue and rolled into a rugged tube for their safety. Giving this as a gift? Don't have time for this to arrive?Click on the images below, relating to the reward tier you've backed, to download a print-at-home gift certificate PDF that you can print and present to your very lucky recipient.  T&C - This certificate is not proof of purchase. For an award to arrive with you or your designated recipient, this project will need to be successfully funded and you will need to have successfully purchased the related reward.Each time we hit a funding goal we'll be unlocking new amazing content for the backers. (Australian Dollars btw)

So far we've unlocked  an extra 5 digital art wallpapers, three unreleased postcard prints, live painting lessons, Chromadepth glasses for all rag / canvas print orders. Up next - full colour gloss booklet and stickers + more  Upcoming we'll be including a brochure update, so rather than a plain paper printout, we'll have a full gloss mini magazine, artwork description stickers, updated security stickers on our certificates and finally a new artwork option for you all to enjoy!  This is the biggest stretch goal haul yet!  Since we only have one stretch goal left, we decided to go big! featuring a huge amount of things for you to look forward to.  + 5 new Full HD digital Artworks
+ 4 new full gloss pages in the info book+ 3 new Postcards
+ 2 painting lessons+ 1 new painting to choose from It doesn't matter who you are, or even what your background is. When we look up at space, we're all equal, we're all the same, and we all belong.   I REALLY believe space artwork is important - because outer space forces us stop focusing on the meaningless first world problems we have and to to instead focus on the bigger picture. It's these contemplation that drive us to be better humans. The curiosity that deep space creates, encourages us to fearlessly push the boundaries of science & philosophy in the pursuit of answers. That is what I'm all about, and if you've read this far, I'm guessing you are too.I really hope you come on this journey with us. Because space is totally bad ass and deserves to be celebratedPs. From the bottom of my heart, Thank you so much!

Is the estimated delivery on the pledges accurate or do you anticipate any delays?;Hey @Joen, well first of all let me give you this sparkly gold adulating badge *hands you a badge of awesomeness* because you've just gone and sorted out your Bro's birthday like way in advance! So that deserves some kind of celebration right?;If you have any more questions (that you can't answer yourself) then I am always here answering questions, excluding when I'm asleep or driving. (hopefully not both at the same time);Oh! and welcome to the Space family!;Nevermind that previous comment. I checked the Campaign text and FAQ for delivery dates and asked when I didn't find any...

I bought a couple of 'em and I'd like to give 1 of them to my brother for Christmas;Thanks for the quick reply Cat.;Hey Daniel, good to hear from you;Although not mentioned, the commissions already come with the digital bundles, postcards, art information booklets, and certificates. But If you'd like to get any additional prints, feel free to over pledge and select them from the addons menu in backerkit. :);Hey Cat
Do the commissions and originals come with the digital bundle and post cards and such or can I just overpledge and get them as addons later in backerkit?;Hey @Roger you don’t need to worry about BackerKit unless you want to add extra things to your pledge.;once the project ends your credit card will be charged and about two weeks later you will receive a survey via an online platform called backerkit.;This allows you to pick which artwork you want and/or add additional items.;so dont how my last comment didnt get on here?? got the 5 prmo, but i dont understand what the backer kit is for sorry i havent had time to read all of them so i missed something?;... The damage done to the pigment will increase if you’ve got it sat in full strength sunlight or sitting under a UV lamp for long periods etc.;@corvinus - how long the glow lasts depends on how much direct sunlight the piece gets.;you should expect the glow to be visible for at least 20-30 years or more but it will start to reduce in intensity after 5 or so.;However this will Be increased I’d youve got it sat in full strength daylight or if;@jonathan - yep @mark is absolutely right, you can add additional funds equal to the value of the products and you’ll then be able to add on in backer kit. You can add more than one print too (I’ll have to update the FAQ to represent that, I didn’t realise it inferred justbkne);I’m assuming the glow-in-dark color fades over time, any idea how long it’ll last approximately?;@Jonathan Nielsen (while Cat is asleep), what you're asking is pretty much what I did last time - pledge for one reward and add credit for the other. Since we know we'll be using BackerKit again, the way this works is that the pledge amount gets turned into credit on BackerKit, then whatever you pledged for gets taken off the credit and the rest is left for 'add-ons' (i.e. the things you added extra for). If you add on more than the available credit, you can pay the extra then.;One thing I'd point out is that the FAQ currently only says you can add on rag prints this way. I'll have to leave that one for Cat.;Hey Jonathan, I’ve seen your message - I’m off to bed now but I’ll answer you properly tomorrow morning :);Hi Cat, my partner and I would love to get one of your canvas prints as well as two of the rag prints, but kickstarter will only allow one selection. Can I just pledge the combined total and it all gets figured out at the end? Also, what is the next stretch goal target? If you can reach it we'll definitely get a canvas of the new print, it looks amazing.;Oh Awrin, come over here and I'll give you a big af hug! Thanks so much for your amazing support - welcome to the space family and thanks so much for joining us on this journey.;Tom ooh hard question - Seriously dude haha. Maybe other people would like to answer.;If I had to pick one hmm, maybe the centre of our universe, ooh but the cats eye nebula - too hard to choose just one.;If you have to pick one only....which one?;First time backing this project all the way from Malaysia :) Im a huge space lover and when i saw this art works, i was blown away. Super cool art works and the fact it glows at night vibrantly, i think its like having a mini galaxy in your house. I pledged for 3 rag art works. One for my room, and the other 2 will be hanged at the living room. Cathrin you rock !! Im so honored to be part of this project. A supernova high five to you !!! :);Hey Fred, that’s awesome! Give my best regards to your daughter.;I’ve heard from a few pretty awesome dads who are organising art for their daughters/ sons in the hope to inspire them to study the stars or to get into STEM subjects (and to end up as cool nerdy geniuses like them) - I think it’s brilliant and actually really heartwarming! :);Hi Cathrin have just had to upgrade to your cyber monday deal...your art is just so good..and shall gift one to my daughter..help spread the word..many thanks;Ah I see @mahmoud I can set up a new tier just for you. Do you want 5 standard sized rags, or do you want any of the Mega XXL Rag prints?;Oh no Cathrin! What I meant is that I wanted the 5 rags AND the 2 canvases, but there is no option for it! It is the one or the other.;Hi @Mahmoud, there are two canvases available still, you may need to scroll down a little more to see them;@Amanda - so glad I could organise what you wanted too :) thanks for joining us for round two hon xxxx;Cathrin, thanks for adding the cyber Monday deal! I was hoping for 5 prints at an early bird price and you delivered. Can't wait to double my collection (5 prints from each campaign).;Catherin I would love to upgrade to the cybermonday deal instead of the early bird deal, but I would be getting it a month later then :(. Also I would love to get two canvases, but there is no option for that either!;Hey @Joshua, only painting so far, maybe astrophysics will come later.;@Daniel, I suppose that’s the beauty of space is that it can be any orientation and it still works :) As it worked out, so many people liked the flipped image I thought I’d stick with that for the prints.;However, I’m a big believer that an original should always remain as intended.;Hey Cat out of curiousity is there a reason why the print of Asteroids no.1 in the campagin is turned 180 degrees from the original in the update you just posted?;Out of curiosity, are you an astrophotographer as well as an astro-painter?;Hey Scotty great question - The reason is because we have to include an extra few inches on each edge of the canvas so it can be stretched around a frame so the printed area is actually a lot bigger that the listed size.;I hope that helps :);Hi! I just ordered two of the fine art canvas prints at 24x35, I'm wondering if there's a reason the canvas isn't available in the 44x34? I only see that in the rag vellum. I read a comment earlier here that indicated canvas is better quality, but after stretching these I'm worried they'll be too small.;@Tom Machado (from last week) - I'm at a bit of an unfair advantage with gravitational waves. I met one of the engineers who built the LIGO detectors a few weeks ago (and has his name on the paper that won the Nobel Prize).;Hmmmm...what you got up your sleeve for the next stretch goal?? $180k is amazing....It is sooo nice to see success unfold in front of you.....;Hey Joshua,;The fine-art paper is stiff but not rigid. This means it rolls easily.;Once the prints arrive with you, if you keep them covered with the special tissue paper and weigh them down, they flatten out beautifully. From there they can be placed into a frame.;If the rag is rigid/inflexible, can it still be shipped in a tube?;Hey Dan, funnily enough it costs me the same to post something overseas as it does to send it around Australia.;Now there may be the possibility that I can do a partial refund of the shipping fees if you want to come pick it up in person once the project is complete though :);Hi Cathrin, thank you for your reply.
I'm just wondering why the shipping fee to Australia is the same as shipping to other countries.. since I'm living in the same area? (for my pledge that is $25 AUD for 4 rag prints)
Or is it a kickstarter system thing..
Thank you;Hey VKA! amazing to hear from you dude :);What a great question!;The difference is 100% cotton rag is like a very heavy dense fine art paper - its not flexible at all and is the sort of thing thats usually placed in a glass frame. The listed sizes do include a blank border so you can frame it.;The cotton canvas is a flexible woven material that can be stretched over wooden bars (unsurprisingly called stretcher bars) and it looks a lot closer to the actual artwork. Its border isn't included in its listed measurements - so the prints will actually be an extra 2.5 inches on each edge so it can be wrapped around the frame - These borders are also fully printed unlike the rag border which is blank.;Over all, the canvas is a lot more expensive material and uses a lot more of the ink and pigments too which is why its a bit more expensive.;:) I hope that helps;Beautiful images. A question from someone not very versed in the art world (but very interested in cool space paintings!): Can you explain the difference between Rag and Canvas? What is the difference if we just want something that will look awesome on a wall? I noticed that the canvas option cost more, even though the borders are smaller. Are the images in fact the same size, with the extra size of the rag representing the border?;Oh wow, Thanks @Daniel - what an amazing surprise to wake up to! I hope you love the 3D glasses, They really blew my mind when I first tried them :);Crazy - still 19 days to go, I'm so grateful for yours and everyone's support x;Congrats on 140k. Only 20 backers to 1000. The 3D glasses are going to be fun to play with.;Hahah @Tom OMFG schtaaaap!;But seriously, we'll be having a party at some point in LA - maybe at a craft beer place, maybe at the observatory. Still working details out. Either way you are welcome to come down and celebrate with us! :D;� Can I pick mine up from you in Hawthorne? ��;Hey Dan! Good to hear from you mate :);With the size of the project, I'm not going to be able to make so many one off variants for everyone (apologies about that) However, I did see that you can get yourself a frame custom made from http://justpictureframingonline.com/frame;if you use an 8cm front mat, in an Italian classic frame, it'll be about $130, the place is based in Glenfield too so its only a little hop away from the city centre - That's probably my best suggestion for a frame for that sized print.;And we'll be shipping from Straya mate! the printing wearhouse is based in Lichardt - woo. :);Stumble upon this art project and I love pretty much every piece of your works! And noticed you are located in Sydney haha (me too, high five!) I ordered 4 rag prints and can't wait to put all of them on my wall.
Just a couple of questions, can the Dragon Head Nebula be able to be printed in rectangular size? Although I think it looks much better in long size but then I will have trouble finding a right frame for it...;And will you be shipping all the orders from Australia?;Thank you and amazing work!;}","$9,076",46,211594.0,"Sydney, AU",576,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cathrin/glowing-galaxies-glow-in-the-dark-deep-space-artwo,20,"{Frequently Asked Questions

Unfold the campaign and discover new and exciting twists and turns as you progress through the story!Dawn of Peacemakers is the third game from Snowdale Design and it takes place in Daimyria, the world of animalfolks. You will take the role of an adventurer and have to trust and co-operate with your fellow players in order to reach a peaceful conclusion between two warring sides. While you can't directly control armies, you have schemes that you can use to influence the tides of war in your favour. If you don't mind spoilers, you can click here to see all miniatures and cards included in the game.In Dawn of Peacemakers, you are an adventurer trying to achieve a peaceful conclusion between two warring sides together with your fellow players. Your objective is to co-operatively lower the motivations of the scarlet macaws' side and the ocelots' side in balance and thus exhaust both sides, making them negotiate a truce.The game's scenarios are played in rounds. Each round consists of player activity and army resolution. First, all adventurers use resource cards for various effects such as influencing armies, moving around, and scheming.After all adventurers have played their turns, the armies will resolve their orders. Each army has different tactics and tricks in their arsenal in each scenario.Both the scarlet macaws and the ocelots have a motivation to continue the war. A side's motivation is lowered by certain order cards and by losing units. If both sides are just close enough to giving up, the sides negotiate a truce and the players win! However, if one side's motivation drops too much, they surrender and players lose.No matter how the scenario ended, players track their progress on the campaign log and always continue to the next one. Keep in mind that your acts have long lasting results on the ongoing war...  You can see the preview of the rulebook by clicking here and the cards by clicking here. As the campaign includes many secrets and surprises, only the first 11 pages of the rules are available. These do not contain any spoilers. We may tweak them slightly based on feedback before the final product is printed. Images and assets are available for press from this link.Please note that the components in these videos are prototype quality and they do not match the final production. For example, any cardboard standees will be replaced by miniatures in the game you will receive.  Dawn of Peacemakers includes sealed containers and secrets. You will encounter many surprises during the campaign letting you reveal these hidden components. Here's a link for those who don't mind spoilers, if you want to learn more.There is a certain degree of persistence in the campaign. A simple example is the unique leaders. If any of them are defeated in any given scenario, they aren't coming back. You will just have to live with the consequences.However, none of the game’s components are destroyed or altered so you can replay any scenario as many times as you like. There are countless reasons to do so as each game will result in different experiences based on how the armies interact with each other. There might be other things too to spice things up, but we can't talk about those without spoiling the fun... The funding goal is set so that we can produce the game with extremely high quality components, including heavy card stock with linen finish. These games are meant to last multiple playthroughs as the game is infinitely replayable!We include the whole experience, if we reach our funding goal. This is why the stretch goals are mostly about small improvements to the game – it is complete and full without any of them.The game is ready and heavily playtested. All miniatures have already been sculpted and are ready for the factory and mold making. Nearly all artwork for the game is ready for print. We will finalize everything during and after this campaign, taking your feedback into account. This will allow us to minimize delays and deliver the game to you according to the schedule. There's also an additional fully fledged game mode named Skirmish! If you want to take a break from all the co-operative peacemaking, you can challenge an opponent to a 1 versus 1 Skirmish. Both players control an army in hopes of dropping the other side's motivation to zero.You can read more about the Skirmish mode from this project update!  You can find a more detailed list of components below. Many counts are marked intentionally vaguely in order to minimize spoilers. You can purchase all the miniatures from the game separately, if you wish. They can also be added to your pledge as an add-on by manually adding $25 to your pledge! Click here to see the hidden miniatures. ""This game is very very impressive, it's a different beast than pretty much anything out there. – As you play through the 12 scenarios it just keeps getting bigger, and bolder, and better.""- Richard Ham, Rahdo Runs Through""There's some very interesting things about this game... I find it really intriguing. – You're really manipulating things in really unique ways... You really have to be careful with those choices.""- Mark Streed, Boardgame Corner / The Dice Tower""There's surprises coming up that we really can't tell you anything more. – You can take the role of the title of the game, which is being a peacemaker!""- Randy White, Boardgame Corner / The Dice Tower""Is it worth that this one soldier dies so that thousand more may live? It taught my daughter a really good story, a really good idea. I saw her mind going through that. I think that is really excellent. – Ultimately the game is just a lot of fun, it has a really great story, it looks cool, plays out cool and we just couldn't wait to get to the next chapter.""- Lance Myxter, UndeadViking""The peaceful premise is something I haven't seen before. Having players put in between two opposing forces, trying to keep them in check, is a brilliant idea. – The illustrations are really charming.""- Mikko Saari, Lautapeliopas""Of all the games I've played with minis on hexes, Dawn of Peacemakers made me sit up and pay attention the most. Unique and highly creative with incredibly adorable and gorgeous art - no other war game (or anti-war game!) has captured my heart like this one has.""- Calvin Wong, Ding & Dent""There are many scenarios, further pieces to unlock, and characters with brilliantly thematic abilities, with lovingly drawn illustrations to match. It really is a very well crafted design.""- Lindsay Miller, Shiny Happy MeeplesPlease note that the components in these videos are prototype quality and they do not match the final production. For example, any cardboard standees will be replaced by miniatures in the game you will receive.    Dawn of Peacemakers is set in Daimyria, the same world of animalfolks in which the Dale of Merchants series takes place. Daimyria is very much like our own Earth but instead of humans, there are intelligent animalfolks. While the technology during the Dale of Merchants games mirrors our beginning of 19th century in Europe, the events in Dawn of Peacemakers take place several hundred years earlier.Why is the scarlet macaw empire Axhiquk attacking the land of the Ocelots, Sak-Awhu? Why are players in the middle of this mess trying to stop it? We discuss this a bit in this project update!  All games will be shipped from multiple fulfillment centers in different regions. This way you don't need to worry about import taxes, if you live in the US, Canada, European Union, or Australia. Appropriate shipping cost is added to your pledge automatically after choosing your country.If you pledged for a game, you can add up to 2 more games and 3 sets of miniatures to your pledge with the same shipping cost. If you pledged for a set of miniatures, you can add up to 2 sets of miniatures to your pledge with the same shipping cost. Simply add $89 per game and $25 per miniature set to your pledge.We will ask in the survey after the campaign how many copies you backed for. While the shipping cost for additional games does actually increase, covering a portion of those costs is our way of saying thank you to all group backers.If everything goes as planned, you will get Dawn of Peacemakers by August of 2018. We prefer to deliver either early or on time rather than overpromise and be late.Retailers interested in backing the game should email us at info@snowdaledesign.fi for more information. We will provide you with clear instructions on how to back the project and get games at discounted price. A proof of a store ownership is required. We would like to thank all playtesters for their generous time and feedback. In addition we're extremely grateful to all backers of our previous projects. We wouldn't be able to create new games for everyone to enjoy without your support.This campaign is run by Snowdale Design who will also publish the game. Club Fantasci is offering Snowdale Design their Kickstarter support. Snowdale Design and Club Fantasci are two separate entities and one's views and values do not reflect the other's.}","Sat, December 2 2017 10:00 AM EST","{We have just mere days left in the campaign.

Hopefully that will give us another boost soon!;@Humpty Dumpty
Sounds like DoP is the right fit for your kids. To get a better feel of the story aspect you should check update #6 or watch one of the runthrough videos.;@Humpty Dumpty - Dawn of Peacemakers has a lot stronger narrative than Dale of Merchants while being a lot more complex as well. You can read more about playing the game with younger children from the BGG thread linked below. You can play with cards on the table fully co-operatively in short. :)
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1891651/suggested-age;I'm still trying to decide about this game. I plan to play with my sons, aged 10 and 7. Most Successful games so far have been Mechs vs Minions, Mice and Mystics, and Near and Far. They quite like Dale of Merchants, but prefer games with more narrative. Would Dawn of the Peacemakers be a good fit?;I just pledged $1 so I could comment. I wanted to say that I absolutely *love* the look and feel of this game, and I'm a huge fan of DoM 1/2 and backed them, but it's just the time of year and a few big campaigns that ended recently that held me back. The price is exactly what I would expect for this type of game. I'll definitely buy this in retail though, thanks for such great games Sami!;Yeah, this time if year is rough. I'm only able to be in on this campaign right now because my girlfriend is paying half of it as my Christmas present.;@Veronica: ain't that the truth. Plus Peacemakers came not long after the huge 7th Continent campaign, and during several highly anticipated and flashier campaigns. That made it rough all around.;I think the timing is also a problem. This is the time of year when Americans, at least, have the *least* amount of money to spend, making big-ticket Kickstarters a really hard sell.;Penny sleeving takes much less room than premium sleeving too.;Hi Sami!;@Quality Beast - The price is definitely one of things holding people back. It's also difficult to convey everything the game has to offer when it has such large amount of stuff hidden to make playing more fun. The spoiler page helps a lot but we didn't have that from the start. It's one of the many things I've changed since the launch based on backer feedback.;@Everyone about sleeved cards - If we end up using a cardboard insert, I fear there's no real designated spot for the cards at all. Cardboard inserts have really limited shapes they can be in. If we manage to get the plastic one, I make sure that most if not all of the cards will fit in it sleeved. The game comes with 420 cards and they already take a huge amount of space, sleeving all of them would roughly double that space. If nothing else, the cards that get used a lot would get more space to accommodate sleeves. Many of the cards are not shuffled that much.;@Serena - No worries, it's just a fun exercise to count the comments. :);@Serena Sami already mentioned it wouldn't be able to hold ALL the cards, sleeved :);It wouldn't be KS without somebody mentioning sleeves. I would be really surprised if Sami didn't think about making any kind of insert big enough for sleeved cards. Not so sure if somebody would want to sleeve other components...;@Sami
I promise not to take the 500th comment from you. I just couldn't resist last night to take the 400th. And I think you had the 300th;Mandatory comment about insert accomodating sleeved cards. :);Talking about insert: whatever material it is done, keep in mind that many of us sleeve the cards.;I sincerely hope that this game funds also! If it does not, I hope a second campaign can see it do so. Perhaps one that has the option to bundle it with the superb game 'Dale of Merchants' 1 and 2? I look forward to the next expansion for that game just as much as I do this one, please revisit this if it does not fund this time around! :) The last days are always a good chance for a game to get a big push though, here's hoping!!;Hello there Sami and team! Great work, the game looks fantastic. It would be a supreme shame if you can't fund; but we believe you will! Last days will bring the crowd again, we hope.;From our side, respectfully, perhaps it was the price point that made it hard for some folks to get behind it? Did you get any feedback along these lines?;How did that happen? I'm speechless. ;);Harsh! You just beat Sami.;Well, you didn't wait long enough. Here is #400.;Just one more until I pounce and reap in my rewards...;Nonsense! How very dare you !;If I write a reply with some nonsense now and two of you reply, I get an easy 400th comment. Agreed?;True, the card insert will beat gravel. And doesn't weigh the same as a witch. Ok, it's been a long day, I'll get my coat.;Light?;Cardboard insert is fine by me! Nice plastic one preferred, of course, but cardboard is better than nothing and lighter than gravel.;Graveless...?;A game with no gravel is. . .;A game with no insert is still better than no game at all;@sami, funding is indeed the priority;@Wheeler - I fear we would have to use a really simple cardboard insert, if we don't meet that stretch goal. I'll see what I can do, if we don't meet that. The most important thing is to get us funded first. :);$89 plus shipping is a LOT of money. But I ordered a copy, because I want this game to become real! I got relevant and well presented info on the game here very easily, thanks. This product looks unique and nice!;@unseen_Giraffe, I hope not gravel cos that would hurt the shipping. It would be different though.;@Giraffe Hahaha! That's one way to stop the components from rattling around!;@Marcello - same. tell a friend about the project!;Just a bag of gravel.;@Sami What's in the box if we don't make it to the insert? Just loose components?;I wish we could get the insert!;Wow! Getting closer!;That would be great news! I'm in £ too ^^;I got all excited there, mine shows in £. Thought we'd got to £50k!;50K!;@Sami i like doing things the rulebook tells you not to do :)
And deem that the rulebook was right afterwards.;@Razoupaf - Yeah, chameleons are a bit tricky. That's why I especially recommend avoiding using them in your first game in the back of the rulebook. After you get hang of them, they're super fun. Chameleons are my favourite animalfolks to play in Dale of Merchants. :);Just one or two backers away from 50k!;Boars are rare in the UK.

Now the saga continues in The Nomad; volume two in the planned trilogy;The Eldest have awakened from their age-old slumber and Midgard and Jotunheim are at the brink of war. When Vali learns of a legendary Jotun witch who can bring back his wife from the dead, he travels North, across a realm torn by fear and xenophobia. But he soon finds himself on a collision course with Rolf Krake, Midgard’s cunning and war-mongering high chieftain, who may hold the key to Vali’s dark past - and the truth about the demon who dwells inside him.      Fall of Gods - the Nomad is the exhilarating sequel to Fall of Gods - She Is Gone, combining the written novel with epic illustration.   Our unique approach to the book medium, is combining the massive amount of illustration with the written novel on every spread of the book. It gives an immersive experience, rarely found in books - we call it a cinematic novel. Fall of Gods - the Nomad is 11.7 x 8.7"", 144 pages. Fall of Gods logo on frontcover will be debossed.      You can add the following products to your pledge, at a discounted price. These will be delivered together with your copy of Fall of Gods, at no extra shipping cost. Please note that you can only order addons if you are a backer at level STANDARD or above.To buy an addon, click the Manage My Pledge button and increase your pledge manually with the total cost (in US $) for the addons you want. Your total pledge also needs to cover the shipping. When this Kickstarter is over, we will send out a backer survey in which you can mark exactly which addons you want. Brimstone: The Demon Within is a contemporary coming-of-age tale set in a treacherous realm that exists beneath our world. It is the story of a gifted girl thrust into a wilderness of wonder and terror, where she is forced to face her deepest fears. We have teamed up with Hollywood screenwriter Will Simmons to create this epic dark fantasy universe. The book is 156 pages, hardcover, and was successfully funded on kickstarter. See the campaign HEREFall of gods - She is Gone was our first Cinematic Novel, and we have learned a lot since then. We are really grateful for all the feedback we have received from our backers. We listened to your great thoughts on the book and redesigned our book format, for our second project, Brimstone.As soon as we saw it, we knew had found a better format to communicate our vision, and show the enhanced quality in story, illustration and layout.We know it is not ideal to have the first volume in another format than the second, but we need to make this change to create a stunning product that can hold up in the future. At some point we hope to do the entire trilogy in this format.You get more illustrations, more pages and a bigger format..Here is a comparison of the two volumes:   Fall of Gods started as a passion project- a collaboration between Art Director and co-founder of MOOD Rasmus Berggreen and Hitman writer Michael Vogt - and you all helped us get the story out to the world. MOOD is an entertainment design agency, located in Copenhagen, Denmark. At MOOD we love designing universes and building worlds for the biggest brands. See more here: moodvisuals.comOur world class team at MOOD is doing all the artwork, and it will be stunning. MOOD is also handling layout and print, to deliver a quality product to you.  We are so excited that 20th century Fox is developing Fall of Gods into an epic motion picture! Maze Runner director Wes Ball is attached to direct the movie and the script has been adapted by Stuart Beattie, writer of Pirates of the Caribbean, Collateral, 30 days of night and many more.    The story is already written and the storyboard done for the entire book. We need your support to finish the Artwork and layout, printing of the book and shipping. We want to give you the coolest book possible and that comes with a cost. This is how we plan our budget:  We are really excited to have been invited to Kickstarter's DRIP.
Drip is a subscription platform, where creators can share their creative work and release ongoing content for the subscribers.It is the perfect place for us to show all the work that goes into creating our universes, and to give exclusive content and updates for backers. You can check out our profile here:  MOOD DRIP   When we launched Fall of Gods, the very talented composer François Jolin wrote a beautiful and haunting book score, to contribute to the Cinematic experience. Listen to the first track Hunt below or go to spotify for the full score.  }","Sat, December 16 2017 10:00 AM EST","{Dear backers;Thank you so much for your enormous support and enthusiasm for Fall of Gods. It's absolutely amazing. We are so close to being 50% funded, so help us... Read more;}",4957,2,"{As a backer for your previous two books, I feel like your campaign would benefit from having some stretch goals or add-ons that would entice more backers and reach your goal more quickly.;For example; partnering with design studio to produce a miniature lineup representing characters and creatures in the books. Just a thought....;Concerned about this hitting the 40k in 16 days...;@Christophe. We are distributing from Germany to European backers, so there shouldn't be any additional tax.;Is VAT included for European backers? Or will there be additional taxes and customs to pay on reception?;@Ivar: Cool you found it. Thanks for letting us know
@Chicky: As Korak says (thanks), you can add ""Add ons"" if you back for standard or more. The e-books will be part of the package, so you can choose to download them if you should feel like it.;@Chiky You can only get add-ons if you pledge standard pledge level or higher, so the 1 euro pledge option does not work for you;Why hadn't you announced it through Brimstone campaign? D: I almost missed this...
question: $1 pledge + $35 + $35 + $35 would get me the three books? I'm not interested in digital ones;Nevermind, just noticed that you already had that option �;Any chance for a Brimstone Add-on?
Best of luck with the campaign!;Thanks for all the great comments, and suggestions, there is something for us to think about :-);@victor: great to hear you enjoy the album. we'll look into the possibilities of another one.
@ved: so happy to read you like Brimstone as well. we are working on making Brimstone available as ebook in iBooks and GooglePlay - stay tuned.
@Jan: we will look into it!
@wade: well spottet!
@jack: we plan on releasing the eBook through iBooks and GooglePlay, and make it available through these platforms to backers as well. This way we can hopefully avoid too much format/device-trouble. but always let us know directly if you have trouble, we'll do everything we possibly can to find solutions.;Thank you all for your great support, and help us spread the word. We can't wait to start the work here!;I really would like to see another album of music composed by François Jolin to accompany this second book in the trilogy. :D;I would also like a digital version of Brimstone.;Very excited for this! Any chance of the Fall of Gods soundtrack being added to any reward tier?;(See the 6th picture in the link I posted for the reference) :p;I had no idea that Supreme Leader Snoke was in this as well! :p;https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/019/199/882/d7ab239c891ed194ce701209e4d9c699_original.jpg…;Hi guys what's the recommended viewing device for the digital set? I've read that people had technical issues in the first FoG campaign but maybe that was down to the device / screen dimensions they were using. I assume a standard laptop screen is better than a kindle or generic tablet? Artwork looks amazing as others have said, warm regards;@Daniel Soh. We are very sorry, but at this moment we can't promise better shipping rates with our current partners. We still hope you want to stick around.;@We haven't planned on it, but will investigate and get back to you.;Will there be an option to get Brimstone in digital format?;I would VERY much prefer the hardcover book. However shipping is US$60 to Singapore which is 150% above the book itself. :( Hope you have alternate arrangements for shipping that can make it reasonable..;@theGunslinger: Thank you so much. We are so happy to hear you love the books.;@Dorian. Thanks a lot Dorian. I know we haven't been specifying that, but we are simply adding the ebooks to this pledge as a bonus. So we can't make the pledge level for the hardcover cheaper. Sorry.;@Howard Kistler. Thank you so much, we are sure that Drip will be a great platform to show our work in progress.;@Rune: Sorry we didn't specify this clearly. We are simply adding the first book as a bonus, for those who didn't get on board in the first campaign.;@Architects of Destruction: Thank you;@Dan Prenger: Thanks for being active here on the comments and clarifying :);@Rune - In case you haven't seen they've updated their FAQ to say that the digital copy of the first book is essentially a gift for backing the project, likely because they probably don't incur any additional costs when sending out a digital copy.;Looks Fantastic!;@MOOD - Why is there no option to only get the digital copy of ""Fall of Gods - the Nomad""? I already got the digital copy of the first book. Why do I have to pay for it again a second time?;I hope you reconsider.;Backing y'all on Drip, but figured I'd throw in some backing here as well to pick up the first volume.;Excellent! So glad to see the saga continue. I already have volume 1 hardcover - which is awesome - and only wish volume 2 hardcover, without the Ebooks: is that possible in the frame of this KS?

STRETCH GOAL NOW UNDERWAY. IF WE REACH THE GOAL, WE'LL ADD SIX MORE SONGS TO THE HOLIDAY DISC, FOR A GRAND TOTAL OF 18 SONGS.*********************************************************************************$35,000 STRETCH GOAL VOTE IS OVER.  THESE TWO SONGS ARE ADDED TO THE ACOUSTIC SHOW SETSYNTHESIZERYOUR HEAT IS RISING********************************************************************************Over the years,Electric Six has given its fans insight into many sides of its creative world.  Besides the regular studio albums the band releases, Electric Six has recorded multiple live records.  It's recorded cover albums.  It's done live show DVDs and rarities collections.  It's even done a doc (or is that mock?)umentary.  However the well is not dry. Electric Six is thrilled to be offering fans something yet again different and unique in its catalogue to fans interested in pledging.  For the first time ever, Electric Six will be recording a collection of holiday songs.  A few years back, we did a recording of the theme song from ""How The Grinch Saved Christmas"" for the AV Club (part of The Onion's comedy and culture empire) and every year when we post it we get tremendous reactions from you, the Crazies. We believe the time is right to pull together an entire collection of holiday favorites, and to do it we need YOU to be involved. You'll see how as you examine the reward packages to the right of this page. We're offering pledgers the chance to pick some of the songs we'll do.  We're even offering to record an ORIGINAL holiday themed song for this record, where you can have some input as to the specifics of the subject matter. Collectively, this disc will be entitled ""A Very Electric SiXmas""  We've already identified a few of the songs we'll do...Silver Bells  Father Christmas (Kinks)You're A Mean One Mr. GrinchChristmas Card from A Hooker in Minneapolis/Silent Night  (Tom Waits)Grandma Got Run Over By A ReindeerThe rest will be filled out by us and  you, the Crazies. We're anticipating a 12 song record.Yet, that's not the only thing we're doing   As is usual for us in these projects, we're doing a two disc set.  So disc one is the holiday record. Disc two is going to be another new endeavor for us. We're going to do a full band acoustic set here in Detroit, and we're going to record it as part of this release. Of course Dick Valentine has performed solo acoustic shows for many years  but this will be something different. This will be more akin to the old MTV Unplugged sessions.  Do you remember when Stone Temple Pilots did an MTV Unplugged? It'll be a lot like that, but even better, because it'll feature songs exclusively from the Electric Six catalog. Imagine, DaVe and Nashinal on acoustic guitars.  Tait? on a REAL piano. The mind reels with the possibilities.  As part of this, we'll offer many of the usual things we tend to do when we have a live recording as part of  a Kickstarter project...we'll let folks determine some songs we'll do, perform on stage with us during the set, etc. Believe it or not, this will be one of the more complicated and potentially exhilarating things we've ever attempted, so we're excited to let all of you be a part of it. This disc will be entitled ""Chill Out!""  We're going to perform this show at Small's (DaVe's bar) in Hamtramck, Michigan on March 21, 2018.  The set will include these songs, with many, many more to be added of course:McDonnellz  Pink Flamingos  Show Me What Your Lights Mean  Steal Your Bones  Big Red ArthurSYNTHESIZER (Stretch goal addition)YOUR HEAT IS RISING (Stretch goal addition)We're bringing back some tried and true packages which we know you all love.  So, yes, the exclusive t-shirt, poster, etc. will all be available.  We'll also do similar things to what we've done in the past in enabling pledgers to become part of the recording and/or show process. So there will be room for you to select songs for either record, or perform either in the studio with us on the holiday record or at the live show in Hamtramck. Our Karaoke disc was so wildly successful that we're doing a Volume 2, with an entirely new set of songs for you to drunkenly sing along with. Of course we're also bringing back some of the Dick Valentine favorites...if you love the idea of a DV crafted mix CD or having your portrait drawn by him or your tarot cards read, those are back in the mix as well this time around.  Yet, we're bringing some new ideas into the fold as well. Ever wanted your very own E6 Christmas stocking, complete with your name customized on top? Now it's available.  How about a set of Dick Valentine drawn holiday cards? Your friends and family will never know what hit them!  We're also, for the first time, offering a Dick Valentine stained glass night light, created by our friends at Glass Action. Light up your life with DV!Pledgers may notice that a handful of packages which have previously been very popular (Soundcheck Experience, Dinner and a Producer and You Choose The Encore) have either been reduced in availability, seen a price raise, or both.  The simple explanation for this is that, though we've enjoyed providing these packages for you over the years, they all have taken a great toll on Electric Six. Learning entirely ""new"" songs multiple times in a tour or having time to prepare for a show cut drastically short has started to strain Electric Six's sanity.  So, we're cutting back on those this time, but we've still made a few available for you if you REALLY want them.We're also bringing back the E6 Subscription Club for a second round! This will function in exactly the same way as it did last time. For an extra $20 added to your pledge, you'll receive a quarterly (so that's 4 times a year, delivered electronically approximately every 3 months) collection of material.  It will include demos of songs being developed for the next Electric Six studio record, so you'll get an early sense of where that record is headed and follow along as the song is developed.  It may also include things like alternate or remix versions of new material. We'll also include the odd outtake or live recording...as an example the band did a live recording in Austin, Texas this past spring and may send some of that material to Club members. We'll also include exclusive photos, etc. Additionally, we're going to include any cover selections or remix selections made by pledgers in this campaign as part of the Subscription Club...so all members will get those sent to them as well as the other material mentioned above. PLEASE NOTE: If you subscribed as part of the ""You're Welcome!"" Kickstarter campaign, your subscription will expire with the material to be sent out at the end of 2017. So, if you want to continue to receive all the great stuff which is part of this club, you'll need to pledge for it in THIS campaign with $20 added to your pledge (or you get it for free if you've pledged for any package of $500 or more).We're really excited about ""A Very Electric SiXmas & Chill Out!"" Now,  just to be clear, it's going to take us awhile to pull all this together, so this will be delivered in October of 2018 (not in time for THIS holiday season, of course). The holiday season is about family among other things and Electric Six IS YOUR FAMILY NOW. Electric Six gonna make everything merry and bright, and then it's gonna take things down a level and cool out with non-electric versions of E6 favorites which will blow your mind. REMEMBER, the ONLY way you can get this set is to pledge in this campaign.  It is exclusive to this Kickstarter. Take a psychological sleigh ride with Electric Six...become a part of ""A Very Electric SiXmas & Chill Out!""}","Thu, December 21 2017 8:43 AM EST",{},2353,3,"{@Nathaniel Crain: thanks!

We’ve done five campaigns (counting this one) and have never asked a pledger for additional money after the campaign has closed, nor have we ever used any external system for collecting information;Are you planning on using the Kickstarter reward surveys to collect information? As a Superbacker I have been disturbed by the practice of Creators using external surveys that then ask for an additional payment for the Backer reward because of the Creator's unexpected expenses. These same surveys also offer ""add-ons"" and other products. Kickstarter is not a retail space. I don't appreciate Backers that treat it as one. Since I have yet to come across this practice with a Creator that uses the reward survey system provided by Kickstarter, I've recently decided to only back Creators that plan on using it. Therefore, please let me know your plans for Backer reward surveys.

We'll also include a high-resolution gift certificate with game art that you can download and print for the holiday season.If you are a game store, distributor, or other business entity in the gaming industry, we would love to work with you! Please email sales@massifgames.com with your credentials and a brief overview of what you are interested in, and a member of our team will be in contact shortly.        At the beginning of the game, choose 1 character, 4 climbing routes, and a starting position on the bottom of the mountain!The goal of Mountaineers is NOT to get to the top. Shocking, right?! Rather, the goal is to obtain the largest number of climbing points, by the end of the game. Players should choose climbing routes that work well together, and are feasible for the current mountain setup. There are 3 types of event cards. Event cards will tell all players how many supply tokens to draw or pay, as well as if any special conditions or special actions are available.Supply tokens are the currency of the game. Think of them as a combination of your energy and purchasing power.Every climber can move to 1 of 6 spaces surrounding their position. Player's should try climb to special positions and on terrain types that match the requirements of their climbing route cards. As you climb, leave route markers to show your trail, and use route locks to protect markers from sabotage!You'll want gear upgrades that work with your climbing strategy. Once you have purchased an upgrade, you can use it again!Automated climbers can move around the mountain, sabotaging and blocking player's routes! Special actions can provide a nice boost to your climbing objectives!The game ends after players run out of event cards. The player with the most climbing points, wins!     Want to know more? Download a copy of our rule book drafts!   Want to help us translate the rules to your language? Send us a message, and we'll set up a public document that you and your fellow backers can use to translate!   Because of the strong international support and interest in this game, we will be updating the graphics on the Upgrade Boards and the Conditions Board to be language independent! This means that the game will be playable in almost any language by simply translating the cards and rule book. French, Spanish, and Italian Language Packs (cards and rule book) will be offered as an add-on through our pledge manager. German cards will be offered separately through a Spieleschmiede campaign.

Through our business relationships with them, we are proud to offer United States, Canadian, European, and Australian friendly shipping on this campaign. Depending on the region, the shipping costs that will be added to your pledge for all reward levels are:  We have partnered with CrowdOx to provide our backers with an easy and high-quality pledge management and fulfillment experience!Through this partnership, we can now offer the ability for backers to have ""late pledges"", upgrade their current pledges after the campaign ends, and purchase add-on items after the Kickstarter has ended!  Add-on Items:*We estimate that language packs will cost around $19. However, the price and contents are subject to change as we work to finalize printing and translation details. Note that we will not be making a profit on these packs, but are offering these ""at cost"" as a service to our Kickstarter backers. If you would like to have a card pack in your language, please message us about the possibility of adding additional translations! *German backers will have the opportunity to purchase a German language pack through a Spieleschmiede campaign, separate from this Kickstarter. We are finalizing our contract with them. If for some reason, Spieleschmiede can not provide this service post campaign, Massif Games will provide it instead.     Please watch this video to see the inspiration behind Mountaineers.Manufacturing a 3D board game of this size and shape is not easy. It has taken 1.5 years to optimize a design that is feasible to manufacture and affordable for gamers. I've already invested $10,000 of my own funds into this project, but I can't do any more. I need your assistance to see this project to the finish line. Mountaineers is nearly finished, and manufacturing and fulfillment companies are ready to go. I’ve done hundreds of play-tests and the mechanics are sound.  Barring final tweaks to the art, graphic design, and component structures, the game is ready to be made!  This isn’t my first Kickstarter, and I started fulfilment on my last Kickstarter in less than 4 months from the project funding.  Please, back this project, and let’s make one of the most unique looking board games out there!       Massif Games is the publishing company I started when I came up with the initial idea for Mountaineers. It is a legally registered Benefit Corporation in the State of Oregon. In fact, we are currently the ONLY board game publishing company in the USA with this designation.    Being a Benefit-Corporation means that we are committing to being an environmentally and socially responsible business. This is something that I’m passionate and very excited about.  Our business is dedicated to giving away time and money for wilderness preservation and fighting human trafficking. In our corporate articles, we have specific goals including:  You can read more about what we do as a Benefit Corporation by clicking here.    When I designed Mountaineers, I also wanted a game that would inspire people to break the stereotype of only wealthy Caucasian men becoming mountaineers, and educate players on basic terminology, alpine techniques, and environmental practices that mountaineering requires.Hence, the artwork and text of Mountaineers attempts to subtly inspire women and minority climbers, and teaches everyone the basics of wilderness survival.  Another interesting fact, many of the mechanics of the game, are very similar to real mountain climbing. Real life mountaineering is all about route finding, route optimization, packing just the right amount of gear, and being aware of your surroundings. As you play the game, you’ll begin to notice these same traits in the mechanics.

However, for events that remove supplies, they affect everybody, not just you. So it would be any player within 2 spaces of a grizzly (for example). Other events (like avalanches) would affect your ability to climb on a certain terrain, but would only apply to you on that turn.;You can definitely play where you can see the next event card, if you want, although I actually intended to add some randomness and unpredictability, just like in the mountains. You never really know when an avalanche or grizzly is going to happen, although if you are in snow or forest, then you should be aware of the possibility. However, I designed these “penalties” to be really light and not harsh, so on turns when this happens, you can focus on climbing or buying upgrades, or using special actions…;@Maxim: No problem, thanks for backing!;@Mélodie: Yes, like Rackar said, it will be in the Pledge Manager.;@Rackar: I agree with you about the add-ons helping with stretch goals. However, I’m also working on finalizing the prices for the cards (hoping to make it less than $19 if possible). So, because of this, I’d prefer to do it in the pledge manager, so we don’t have to offer any refunds or anything… I’ll keep you guys posted on this though, as it’s one of the things I’m working on today.;@Rackar Bien compris. Je vais donc mettre la somme correspondant au jeu et aux frais de port sur Kickstarter, et je complèterai dans le pledge manager.
Merci beaucoup pour ces éclaircissements !;@Melodie Je pense qu'il faudra prendre cette option lors du pledge manager vu que le prix n'est pour l'instant qu'une estimation.
Pour avoir été confronté plusieurs fois à ce genre de problème, il faut mettre une somme de base pour participer au kickstarter puis lors du pledge manager on peut augmenter sa participation (pour payer les frais de ports ou des addons) mais jamais la baisser. L'avantage de mettre le montant comprenant les addons dès le début c'est que l'on participe à obtenir des SG. On peut bien entendu mettre la somme minimum et attendre le Pledge Manager mais c'est un peu dommage.;However, I have a question : I have pledged the game + shipping (109$). Do I add 19$ (for the translation pack) now ? Or after, during the pledge manager ?
Thank you ;);I’m very happy to discovered a French add-on to the game ! I wanted to pledge this game at the beginning of its campaign, but, my children speaking (and reading) only French... You made it possible ! Thank you ;);Like the idea of plastic mountaneers (also notice the hint for possible expansions;)
And also many thanks that you'll change some boards to be language-independent (I haven't noticed this part when I first checked the page, so this was a pleasant surprice);One more quick question: if an event has a condition that affects the amount of supplies each player gets (e.g. “if you’re near a grizzley bear, lose 2 supplies”) is there a way to plan for this? In other words, was I in a position to know on the prior turn that a grizzley bear event would come up next? Or is the event secret until it happens, so that it’s pretty much a luck-of-the-draw type thing as to whether it affects me? (I think being able to plan would be nice, but it’s not a big deal either way. If you’re goal is no-planning in order to generate randomness/unpredictability, there could be a varient where events are revealed 1 turn before when they occur, to allow for planning.);Boardgame-Hero mentioned us in their video.

It lets you know if something is wrong at home - without using invasive cameras. When the unexpected happens, Point alerts you and your family, friends and neighbours, so that your community can help each other.   Point is more than just a home alarm; it is giving your home a voice. By utilising environmental sensors and machine learning Point understands important events in your home. Point notifies you of events that matter the most to you: intrusions, smoke, loud music late at night or sudden temperature changes. This information is presented on your phone and will be available to you no matter where you are. Point does this all while respecting your privacy—no cameras or eavesdropping. Point senses when you are leaving your home and automatically switches on the burglar alarm. If you prefer to turn the alarm on and off by yourself - there's also a setting for that! Point can detect emergencies such as a break-in or smoke, and alert you and your community right away. Your community of friends, family, and neighbours can communicate with each other and act in case of an emergency. Point can also send text messages to friends who are not using the app.   Over time Point can inform you about hard-to-discover home environment issues.  The home screen provides you with a 24 hour overview of your home, while the timeline provides you with insights about your home over a long period.   By combining sound and environmental sensors with artificial intelligence, Point can understand what is happening in your home. It is trained to detect specific events, such as intrusions, smoke, and different types of alarms. When an event that matter to you occur it is immediately forwarded to your phone. Most processing happens on Point and raw sound never leaves the device. This way your privacy is protected.  Point connects over Wi-Fi and runs on a rechargeable battery that lasts 6-12 months depending on environment conditions.Your friends and neighbours can receive messages from Point through a text message or you can share access using the free app.With HomeKit™, Point easily integrates with the rest of your home. Turn on the alarm automatically when you leave the house. Point is also compatible with IFTTT which allows you to connect it hundreds of applications and products to trigger reactions based on events discovered. For the adventurous there is an HTTP API available if you want to build your own integration. The response to our first Kickstarter campaign in 2014 was overwhelming. The first expression of a new softer approach to home security, Point, is now installed in thousands of homes across the world. Yet something was missing. Ironically it was you.We have upgraded Point on all fronts. But by far the biggest addition is the community. People are eager and able to help each other out. That's why your community is front and center in the new app.   Every box includes one Point, a USB charging cable and an easy to install magnetic mounting plate for Point.                  Changing home security is not a simple task. That is why Minut has partnered with two Fortune 500s to bring Point to more people. We are seeking strategic partnerships in insurance, telecom, and the utility sectors. If you are interested in working together or have any questions please reach out to us at hello@minut.com.

You're right, we have a lot of Apple influence and use it extensively in the campaign. There are apps available for both platforms and they are being updated in parallel. About 45% of our current customers use Android.;If network is down, sensor data is still being collected and buffered, but events detected won't be delivered until network is back. Data sent to servers, beyond the actual events detected, is temperature, humidity, noise levels, barometric pressure, battery levels, and features extracted from events detected.;Security is multi-layered. All communication is encrypted. Wifi is offline for most of the time making it difficult for external attacks.;Hello,
Just as a quick reminder : we are not all Apple users, hope that we (the Android crowd) will not be considered as second class backers/users, as this campaign seems to be VERY Apple centric :-)
A quick question, what exactly is sent to your server(s), what will not work if your server(s) are down (or home router), and how will you secure the whole thing ?
Thanks.;@Thomas, the subscription will be tied to the account used to the fulfill the Kickstarter pledge.;If I backed more than one Point. Can I pass one to my children if they move away for work and still be entitled to the free lifetime account?;@leftwingerl The subscription is personal and tied to the account, not to the Point, so you can add more at a later stage!;@Richard The piezo-siren is separate from the speaker. The siren is used for loud alarms and the speaker for notification sounds. It's not completely defined yet, but our thought is for Point to use the notifications for gentle things like when the first person comes home to turn off the alarm. The siren is for emergency situations. The reason we're not certain that the siren will work as a characteristic is to do with the hardware architecture. Point isn't constantly connected in all circumstances, which could make the delay too long for a good user experience. It's a good idea and it could be possible, but it's non-trivial so we need to verify that it will work before we make promises.;Will the subscription dependent on the number of point devices? The reason for my question is, if I back for one Point device right now and later on realize that I need another device, will I have to pay for the subscription in addition to free lifetime subscription of the kickstarter device?;Is the speaker in Point used for anything else but the siren ? If there is no other use, can you make it a speaker characteristic ? The trigger value is either ON or OFF;@Christopher I worked on the Apple products you mention before starting to work on Point, so needless to say we’re fans too. ;-)
HomeKit support is a very high priority and while there are some aspects we haven’t tested yet we plan on supporting as much as possible. What use-cases are you most interested in?;@Richard There must have been a bit of a misunderstanding. We plan to make Point an occupancy and motion sensor for HomeKit! We’re just being upfront about this not being tested yet. As you say though, there’s no reason why it shouldn’t work just fine.
Regarding the siren, we couldn’t find an existing characteristic for this so it’s not as straightforward to do, but if it’s possible to implement we plan on doing so once the core functionality is in place.;有没有中国大陆的朋友想一起团购的呀？加我微信TechiespaceKF;I'm with Richard on this. I and many others I'm sure are living in an Apple ecosystem, using Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad, MacBook, etc. Having better/more HomeKit support will be great.;If the motion sensor is not going to be Homekit enabled, then this isn't going to be as useful to Homekt users. If the siren is not going to be able to exposed as a characteristic, then this is going to be problematic as well.;Right now, there are tons of sensors that expose temperature, light, and humidity to Homekit. The iHome 5 in 1 Smart Sensor does this, as well as the Philips Hue motion sensor, just to name 2 off the top of my head. These products go on sale a lot and sell for about $20 a piece. So, most Homekit users already have a bunch of these sensors in their house already.;I can't see why you can't make the motion detector Homekit capable. Right now Philips Hue, Elgato Eve, and the Logitech Circle 2 can do this right now, just to name a few products.;What we don't have is a Homekit siren, which is the missing piece that this product could supply. To get a Homekit siren, what people do right now is go to Amazon, but a siren and a power supply, and hook the power supply into a Homekit smart plug like the iDevices or iHome smart plug. From there, we can turn the siren on and off by turning the plug on and off.;But Point has a much elegant solution if you can enable the siren to be Homekit capable. Even better if you have the motion detector Homekit capable. Without those two feature, I'm not sure how viable this product will be to Homekit users. I can see the appeal to non-Homekit users though.;if you can't make the siren Homekit capable, I'd have to drop my pledge, as I have other Homekit products that fill the gap in what you are providing with the other features. I don't have any use for your non-Homekit features, so those are not a draw for me to keep my pledge.;Can you look into the making the Siren and motion detector Homekti capable some more ? If it really can't be done, then I'll drop my pledge and move on.;@Richard We took this back to the engineering team to get some clarifications. We will expose temperature, humidity and light as characteristics as well as allow arm/disarm to be set as scenes. This should make it possible to use Point as a thermostat, be part of a bigger security system or to control a humidifier for example.;We could let Point be a motion sensor or occupancy sensor service but we have not tested this. We're not certain about whether it would work to turn the siren on or off so this is also something we'd have to dive a bit deeper into before we can make promises. In general though, we will try to use the Apple-defined HomeKit services when possible to let users control Point with the Home app, Siri and to create scenes. We hope this helps!;I'm not sure what you mean by over/under thresholds. Homekit does not work like that. You expose characteristics, and the Homekit framework allows the user to set thresholds themselves For instance, you expose Temperature as a characteristic, and the Homekit framework allows the user to set thresholds in any Homekit enabled app..;Temperature and Humidity must be exposed as Homekit triggers, like the standard Homekit temperature sensors on the market. Homekit does not currently support sound as a trigger, so there is not much you can do there. Smoke detection must also be a trigger.;For your motion detector, the system need to expose the sensitivity of the motion detector as in High, Medium, and Low. It also, needs to expose the timeout in which the motion detector decides there no motion is being detected. The Armed and Disarmed modes must be exposed as Homekit characteristics, so that I can trigger them via Geo Location. So, when I leave and enter the house, the system can arm and disarm itself respectively. The Armed and Disarmed modes should also be exposed so that I can set them in a Homekit Scene, that way I can use them on set schedules.;When the siren is active, that should also be a Homekti trigger, so that other I can trigger other things to happen when the siren goes on and off. The siren should also be able to be activated in a Homekit scene as well. For instance, if my existing Homekit window/door sensor is triggered, I should have the option of triggering the siren when the door is open and turning it off when the door is closed.;I have over 40 Homekit products and Point seems like it can fit in with my existing system, but only if the right Homekit triggers are exposed. Can you explicitly state what your current triggers will be ? The over/under threshold statement below doesn't make sense to me in the Homekit world.;@Richard We’re open to suggestions, but the plan is to expose over/under thresholds and alarm events. Is there anything else you’d like to see added? Thanks for backing!;What Homekit triggers will be exposed by point ?;@goodoldpapa Yes, there’s a setting in the app called “silent alarm” that does what you describe!;Hello Minut Team;is it possible deaktivate the siren so that I get only an quite Alarm by the app when smoke, noise, movement will be detected by Point.;@Milad, it is possible to connect Point with IFTTT and will be possible to connect it with HomeKit. Using these tools you might be able to automate your lights.;Hey guys, great project and been looking for this for a while now! One thing that would really help me with my smart home setup is to use the Point as a trigger for turning the lights on or off when I come home and leave home. Do you think that is possible to do?;@HellandB Yes, that’s a good description of what alarm recognition does! We can’t yet add custom alarms from a specific customer though. Thanks for the encouragement!;How does ""Alarm Recognition"" work? Will it detect the alarm if my current smoke alarm system go off, and notify my mobile through Point app? Can Alarm Recognition learn the sounds of different alarms in my home and manually set up to trigger event for each alarm sound?
Soon 1 million SEK pledged, way to go!;@Jon Yes! The backend know when a Point should have checked in, and if it doesn't the Point is reported as offline. Point is still collecting data in this state, and much of the functionality is still there, but it won't be able to reach the backend to upload the data until the wifi/power comes back. Hope this helps!;Will the minut backend send an alert to the app when a point goes offline? An alarm system that can be silenced by cutting wi fi is pretty vulnerable. I know that I requested this feature on version 1. Basically I’d like an alert when the wi fi in my house goes out.;@Minut Thank you for your reply;@Marko If the electricity or wifi goes out Point will continue to work and collect data. Only after a few days will it run out of memory to store the information. Alarms, smoke and motion will still be recognised! When electricity/wifi comes back Point will reconnect and send all the information that was stored over the offline time. Hope this helps!;hello there ppl...;since i already own video security system for years, i went through hell and back with some issues on site.
That's why I wanted to ask you if you can clarify some stuff for me.;What happens if there is electricity shortage or WiFi malfunction?! Can this device make a Point? (pun intented)
Does it have some internal recording slot for SD card or secured algorithm to get back online, after the electricity or WiFi source powers up again. Im asking because I had a lot of those emergency situations with factor X.;Thx in advance;@Douglas Short, Hi! Point contains a smoke detector similar to other commercial optical fire alarms, but is not certified according to regulatory requirements and does not replace a certified smoke detector. That said, some features in Point will continue to operate without the backend. It will also continue to collect regular sensor data for as long as possible (several days) and upload that as soon as connectivity is reestablished.;@Alexander FritzBox did a firmware update that remedied a lot of the problems and we haven't heard of many reports since then.;@Leon Thank you! Yes, we hope it will help! :-);@JSL, there is nothing in the pledge description regarding beta points. The Black Friday special is just a special price for 3 normal Points.;@MINUT I just backed the project with the black Friday special. Does that mean one of my points will be a beta point? Confused.;@MINUT: I had a question related to backend vs front end on the point. I completely understand that point is dependent on the backend for it to make use of its features. That being said, there is one critical function in my mind that I would need to be local. I’m looking at using these to replace the smoke detectors in my house. If the Internet were out (say due to a power outage, or just normal ISP issues) and one the sensors detected smoke, would it be able to make its alarm go off without having to contact your servers? I obviously understand app notifications, etc wouldn’t work, but I’d still need the local highly audible alarm to go off.;Do you solve the problem with fritzbox router connection?;@Minut: Congrats for your last funding round , well done! That should secure your insecure backers. Good point? or better POINT? :-);@Simon Thanks for backing! We've designed Point to be able to be tuned to work with pets, but we can't guarantee that it will work (especially for larger dog breeds) because we haven't done any testing yet. We have office dogs so testing will start soon though!;@Those of you worried about contingency! We know of no way to build a product like Point without relying on connection to a server. How Point acts in different situations depends on a state that lives on the backend. The intelligence and learning is to a large extent also part of the backend. There is no easy solution to cut this dependency or make it transferable to another entity. Even with access to all the code and crypto-keys it would be hard for someone without the know-how the Minut team has built up over the years to continue the service.
The best for customers, employees and Minut itself is really to focus all resources on becoming a sustainable business. That’s why we’re planning on making Point a subscription service in the future (which all Kickstarter backers will get free lifetime access to). With this business model we’re less reliant on continuous sales and have every incentive to keep investing in the service to retain customers. Rather than focus our energy on creating safety-nets that are unlikely to hold we want to put all our efforts towards this goal. Kickstarter is a large part of that! Your support and your pledges helps us make great strides towards becoming sustainable and for Minut to be a sustainable company is really the only thing that can ensure that Point will continue to keep your home safe.;The nature of any startup is to be merge or sold at some point. When recently Nokia acquired Withings, they kept the product line, it's not always the case, but it's unlikely that the buyer just dump all the users and let them leave somewhere else. Same goes for any company when a market consolidate. My 2 cents;That's the point, I am not sure to support a product that's needs server connection to run. Company's grow and company's give up. When I equip the whole house with ""points"" it is expensive and at the first point, risky for me. If Minut close the doors, I can throw the whole stuff into the trashcan. This, could happen because there is no guarantee!;If Minut sells their stuff to a bigger company, then they could say ""hey buddy from now on you have to pay a monthly subscription"" if you want to use these devices. That's the other thing!;I just got an email from Emberlight saying that they are shutting down so all of their products will shut down. Something to ponder - make an exit strategy is warranted - but this isnt a $2000 home alarm system.
I just backed anyway - this is something I like the look of. One question - how does Point learn about pets? We have three small dogs and I don't want an alarm notification when they run around like crazy things during the day.;Yes, I understand that to learn and evolve it'd need access to the servers (I like Christopher Tan's suggestions btw), but a device that works moderately good vs a one that's totally crippled in case you (and I really hope you don't) go out of business is quite a difference when handing out 70-80$ per device.;Thank you for your clear and quick response.;Thank you for your explanation. It would be great if Minut have some kind of contingency in place for users like us if you go out of business. Don't get me wrong, I would love to see Minut do well and keep growing. However, we have also seen many Kickstarter startups go bust. What kind of contingency? Well, there are various options, like releasing everything to open source if things go south, so that the community can pick it up and continue. Or possibly, the server operations can be separated into a different entity with sufficient funding to go on for at least a certain number of years ... things like that will go a long way to assure your customers that their devices will live on.;@Mikael It's not really the data collection that's the problem. The intelligence in Point, especially the learning aspects, are split between the back-end and the device. It's very far from a simple sensor that just transmits data to a database for later exposure on an API. Many of the classifiers rely on different types of neural networks that live on the back-end, so even if you were to be able to connect to a different server much of the functionality would be lost. This will be true for most IoT devices smarter than simple sensors just capable of collecting time-series data.;> If we go out of business then Point won't work anymore unless someone acquires the assets and decided to keep running the servers.;Any possibility to allowing data collection to another server than yours? Was really interested in Point until I saw that the device will just be a dumb brick if you go out of business (bad enough with the possibility of future security issues that might turn up).;Don't get me wrong, the API you have seems great and I'd love to use it. But I'd prefer to be _able_ to use the device without an internet connection and some server somewhere.;@Leon_le We are the people who were always picked the last! ;-);@Creator: Are you guys as good as the Swedish National Football team :-)
Looking forward to this!;@Mr.Mo Great! Sorry that we didn't understand at first! :-);Ok, thank. That's what I want to know. ;);@Mr.Mo If we go out of business then Point won't work anymore unless someone acquires the assets and decided to keep running the servers.;}","$25,000",39,148300.0,"San Francisco, CA",120,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/minut/pointthe-friendly-home-alarm,11,"{Frequently Asked Questions

Onto the story...Between being on the road touring in support of my recent EP and getting married, I've been writing feverishly. I've spent the last year making many positive changes in my life, and I'm more excited and more inspired than ever before. I've taken my old formula and turned it upside down because... I want to!I've been in hibernation mode and reconnecting with my creativity. Sometimes when given absolute creative freedom, it comes with great excitement, as well as great risk. The thing is, I've never felt more prepared to take such a risk.Out of this joy, an idea sparked, and this campaign came to life.Why? Because I want to continue creating music for the very people who've supported me along the way. Together, I believe we can create something meaningful and special. And you know what they say, the distance between dreams and reality is called action, so with that said, this is... WHAT A GIRL'S GOTTA DO. Last year, I was prepared to hang up my proverbial hat, and wrote what I thought was going to be my last song (""Final Bow""). But somehow, as I started to let go, more goodness started to happen around me, things slowly began to change and the tide turned.I realized that I am a good songwriter, and there are people who find comfort in my songs. Your outpouring encouragement gave me a reason to dust off those little red boots and put paper to pen.When I released my first independent EP earlier this year, I took control of the creative process in a way I had never done before. It was an incredibly exhilarating thing.So with this new project, I thought, why not take the reigns even more and create an album in this modern-day-and-extremely-terrifying-yet-thrilling-but-super-fun-because-you’re-doing-it-with-your-people kind of way?So I came up with a project that combines my love for the following things: I'm currently in the studio making some of the most heartfelt songs of my career. Help me bring the project to life by supporting one of the reward packages listed on this page.The project HAPPENS once we make the $30,000 goal, but as we continue to raise funds, we'll unlock additional rare and cool items, like LIMITED EDITION RED VINYL copies of the album.Everyone who supports the project has my everlasting gratitude and I can't wait to see you out on the road in 2018 (unless you live in Australia, in which case I'll see you in a few weeks!)
