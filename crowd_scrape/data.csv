A factory work and high school drop out, Hartsoe became one of the industry's most successful independent publishers of the decade. Hartsoe formed London Night Studios, an innovative publishing company that launched the careers of many newcomers that went on to work for Marvel and DC comics, While manning the helm at LNS, Hartsoe brought marketing to a new level with many ideas now being emulated by the big 2 publishers even today.Hartsoe is an established artist, writer, editor, and publisher who laid the groundwork for many other independent publishers to follow. He created a universe built around his cult hit Razor that included such properties as Morbid Angel, Poizon, Knightshift, Tommi Gunn, and Stryke. Hartsoe has over 6 million copies of his comics in circulation during his career, a number that would thrill any publisher.Often referred to as the Godfather the ""Bad Girl"" comics' genre. The self-publishing legend broke new ground when he joined forces with E! Channel creator, TV exec Alan Mruvka and award-winning designer Marilyn Vance to create the comic book character EMBRACE with Carmen Electra as the model.In 2005 House of Hartsoe was formed to bring his comic book properties to the growing digital market.2013 Hartsoe joined forces with film producer Jeff Most ( The Crow) to launch Most Publishing a web, tv and film development division with Hartsoe's flagship title RAZOR as the first property development for a major motion picture from Most Films and helmed by The Fast and The Furious director Rob Cohen.In 2015 Director Pearry Teo and Bleiberg Entertainment's Ehud Bleiberg tap comic book legend Everette Hartsoe to bring Teo's dark film spin of the Brothers Grimm fairytale Curse of sleeping Beauty to the comic book and graphic novel markets to coincide with the film's release and expand the films brand into many different ancillary markets.2016 Everette Hartsoe will launch his biggest endeavor to-date, when the doors of Evolutionary Comics open with the supernatural action HEXANNE. The legendary creator states that this company will provide intellectual properties that have a first draft script, design work as well as the comic book storyboard already packaged for film and TV.2017 Curse of Sleeping Beauty film by Pearry Teo based on the comic by Everette Hartsoe was picked up by Netflix and served as a pilot for distributor XLRATOR's new TV division to expand the ""Curse-universe"" further with a Curse of Sleeping Beauty scripted series. Everette Hartsoe serves as executive producer for the Irish Thriller, Zoe Kavanagh's Demon Hunter and the psychological thriller Michele Grey Hartsoe's UNRAVELLED due in 2018.             "

Our goal is to bring the values we use for our first show, Anime St. Louis, and apply them to a comic book convention. We want to offer a comic con with more programming, socialization, and is easier to attend than something in a large city.  St. Louis, MO has a thriving geeky community that we wish to keep supporting.Comic cons are known for their expo shopping halls and huge guest lineups for signings. Like Anime St. Louis, we want to offer a hand selected lineup of vendors and artists to ensure our attendees are getting the cream of the crop. This means we want vendors who carry quality or harder-to-find items, not bootleg merchandise; artists of all kinds who create fantastic and diverse works, both original and that pay homage to their favorite stories; and booths with activities for attendees to play at and interact with. We want to bring in programming that we’re known for that generally isn’t the main focus at comic con events. We believe programming is a core part of socialization and entertainment at conventions, and we want to bring the geeky community out to have an experience they won’t forget. Programming like speed socialization (both for friends or dating), dances, concerts, a wide range of panels and more! This second event will also allow us to also do things we can’t normally do with Anime St. Louis. We’ll be able to bring in guests who don’t fit the genre(s) of our other show, such as those from more American shows or comics. We’ll also be able to include more vendors & artists, and more activities or exhibits that are better for an expo hall as opposed to closed off in a ballroom.We’ll be utilizing a familiar venue for our audience and staff, the Gateway Center in Collinsville, IL. We were able to grow Anime St. Louis there, and we know we can grow this event there too. We will be utilizing a part of the Center Hall exhibit space (Dealers & Artists), the LaSalle Ballroom (Special Events), and Conference Wing (Panels & Presentations). By using these spaces, we’ll be able to centralize everything and avoid having a confusing layout for our first year. The event will also be two days to start in order to keep the budget within reason. Our stretch goals will allow our backers to determine if the event will have more space for more content, as well as a potential third day.The $5,000 from this campaign will do towards the start-up costs for the event, namely venue deposits and initial marketing.  We are being realistic and aren’t aiming to make promises we can’t keep in terms of guests, attractions, and physical rewards. With over 12 years of convention running experience, we’ve seen our share of bumps and bruises for promises and realistic goals. We know our limits and what our team is able to do already from our other con.We're keeping the rewards at mainly just event passes so that the money raised will go solely back into the event's production (save for the Guest Experience Reward, where part of that goes towards our wonderful guest, Kyle Hebert).  Cons rely on great attendance to produce great content, and we do not wish to let you guys down!This campaign isn't just about rising money, it's also seeing how many are interested in seeing this produced.  If we're able to go beyond our initial startup funding, then we will know we need to add-on more than initially planned.  So for our first stretch goals, we are looking at the following:$10,000 - Double the Expo Hall space to allow more vendors, artists, and attractions at the show.$15,000 and over - Add-on additional time to the show itself.  This may be as minimal as add-in a day for move-in so we can have more time in the two days planned, or add a whole third day of programming.We want this con to grow, just like any other event. Depending on growth, we want to book the entire Gateway Center by year 2 or 3, and then the meeting spaces in the Doubletree by year 3 or 4. We also want to keep the event at this venue; we currently have no plans to move it even if attendance hits a certain point. Would this mean an attendance cap? Hard to say, but we hope not. We’d monitor how the attendance flows and make sure to accommodate as many folks as possible. Admission and booth price would also be kept within reason. We want this to be an affordable convention.

Nance spends her life attempting to curate her life on social media to negate the affection she lacks from her husband at home. Meanwhile, Jerry, an awkward African-American jewish man catfishes Nance through the Tinder dating app, posing as an aggressive & gruff biker--the very opposite identity, creating a story of intrigue, desperation, deception, and romance. Nance is about the identities we perform online, the relationships created in the modern digital age, and most importantly, the identities and insecurities we hold within ourselves.This film is shot entirely on an iPhone 8 Plus. The camera gave us the flexibility and mobility we wanted to move on the fly and more importantly was a chance for us to combine both form and content. Our characters hide within the digital realm of smartphone & social media. In our case, we have used the iPhone as the lens through which their identities are exposed and examined. Shooting on the iPhone gives the film a viral, realistic look that reminds us that every person has their own story.Nance follows characters of often misrepresented demographics in film; conservative women and African-American men. Representation is an integral part in understanding diversity and the contemporary political world, and as filmmakers it is our duty to work to represent accurately, genuinely, and without bias. The story is, at it's most basic level, about modern humanity and the connections and misconstructions formed through social media, and the often volatile zones that can be created in the digital age. The film is not designed for further any political view, but to represent the honest humanity of every individual regardless of their race, gender, class or politics.Writer & Director - Corey PopowskiCorey Popowski is a senior film production major at Emerson College. He is honored to be bringing this story to life as a part of Emerson's BA Thesis program. His passion for writing and directing started in the 6th grade at the Charleston County School of the Arts where he was a theatre major through the 12th grade. Corey has produced, written, directed, and edited multiple narrative and documentary short films, some of which you can view on his Vimeo page. In addition to filmmaking, Corey is an avid photographer and is currently the president of Developed Images, Emerson's one and only photography magazine. Corey has been developing Nance for over a year and could not be more thrilled to share it with the world. In the future, Corey hopes to continue to create films about characters like Nance and Jerry, that are less commonly represented in media. Producer - Jacob Bridgman Jacob Bridgman is a Boston area Producer & Director, who has worked on over two dozen short films. Jacob has produced two thesis films, directed three shorts, and worked on a environmental documentary feature since 2015. His work has shown in the Northampton Film Festival and has aired on community access television. For him, the strongest stories come from uncommon characters confronted with unfamiliar situations, and Nance is perfect example in this respect. He's been working on the project for over 9 months and could not be more excited to see the final product come to fruition. He is currently a Junior in the Bachelor's of Fine Arts Film program at Emerson College.Producer - Isabel EIsabel E is a current Junior studying Visual and Media Arts Production at Emerson College. She has worked on numerous short films during her time at Emerson, in addition to venturing outside of the college community by producing several commercial and feature sets in Los Angeles. Her continued interest and experience in the visual arts has made her seek out projects that focus on mixed media, and Nance is no exception. The innovative cinematography and writing style of Nance is incredibly original in the film department at Emerson, and something Isabel, as well as the entire crew, are so grateful to have dedicated their time to.Director of Photography- Claudia FryeClaudia Frye is a senior studying film production at Emerson College. She is the cinematographer of Nance. She started filmmaking in high school and has continued to learn since. Claudia loves the collaborative efforts filmmaking provides for all that are involved. Working with Corey and bringing life to Nance was an incredible learning experience as well as rewarding process. Being the cinematographic eyes behind Nance was a culmination of her time at Emerson College. Claudia would like to thank her friends and family for their unwavering support — without them this wouldn’t have been possible.Phyllis Gordon is Nance A Meisner trained actor, Phyllis Gordon has performed everything from Shakespeare to Agatha Christie at top regional theatres. She has been seen and heard on network and cable TV as well.Phyllis does voiceover narration work for PBS Frontline and records audio books for the Library of Congress and Audible. She played a lead in an episode of ""I'd Kill For You"" (NBC Peacock), and created and starred in her own web series about a failed relationship, ""Who Does That?"".A stand up comic, Phyllis has performed in New York clubs like Standup NY, Gotham, and Greenwich Village Comedy Club, and Boston area clubs like Improv Boston and the Comedy Studio. On stage, she's facially expressive, and her act is full of characters and energy.Indigo Bishop is JerryIndigo Bishop lives in Boston has been doing local theater for two years. He has been delighted to get involved in cinematic acting, and working with Corey on the unique character of Jerry. When he's not hopping into different roles, he's usually creating and performing music. Indigo's varied interests have made him into a superb eclectic artist.Disclaimer--we've already shot the film. However, the costs are running high and with only a 300 dollar grant from the college, the production team had gone into debt, funding the film from their own pockets to date. As college students, this has been a stressful process, but necessary due to the production requirements. We respectfully ask for a donation in any amount to our production. Every 10 dollars feeds one crew member for a day, and every 25 dollars covers a day of travel costs. Backing a Kickstarter film means joining a community of people who are devoted to youthful ingenuity and enjoy watching projects build from the ground up. By donating to this film, you are supporting the next generation of film professionals; the future of film itself is at stake.If you are unable to give, we'd love if you would share our Kickstarter around to others. The more people who see it, the more likely we are to to be successfully funded.Photos by Mia Schaumberg       "

So I formed a company, INDTB!, LLC (“It’s Never Done That Before!”), filed the Tumultum trademark registration, acquired the tumultum.com URL and am looking for the necessary funding to have a proven, domestic development firm (already chosen) produce a world-class series of apps.That development company came personally recommended to us by the founder and CEO of one of the world’s most successful game companies – and along with tens of millions of other players, you probably already play one or more of that game company’s award-winning apps every day.The first of the games, Tumultum I, will introduce players to six types of puzzle packages for solo play:• TQuiz – trivia puzzles in dozens of categories and multiple question styles (which can also be used in an educational environment)• Tictionary – word definitions (vocabulary)• Tumultum Lyrics – famous song lyric puzzles and questions• Enough Said – famous quote puzzles and questions• Movie Lines – famous movie script line puzzles and questions• Number Nemesis – a math aficionado’s (or student’s) worst nightmare – imagine reverse math where you’re given the answer and have to put the formula together.More puzzle types are also planned - including religious scriptures and even Shakespeare.The basic Tumultum I game platform will sell for $0.99 USD in app stores and one free puzzle per day will be available (with a non-intrusive ad) for all Tumultum players. Ad-free puzzle packs of 30 will be sold in app stores for $0.99 USD.Tumultum II will add some in-game features and more importantly, introduce online competitive play with timing and scoring – one vs. one, team play (pairs) and group tournament play. It, too, will sell for $0.99.INDTB! will also sell a PC-based app for people who want to design Tumultum puzzle packs and have them published and sold through INDTB! in app stores with revenue sharing for the designer. (This application will also be made available to educators at no cost for use in K-12 school settings.) We anticipate a large community of puzzle designers to participate, and if you pledge $25 USD or more, you’ll receive a free copy of that designer tool when it comes out.The timeline for design, development, beta testing and first Tumultum I iOS product release is approximately 4 months from funding – around the end of April or early May. A PC version will follow by the end of the 6th month and the first Android version(s) will deploy around the 9th month. Depending on revenue, Tumultum II's roll-out could be within 12 months.The majority of the $175K budget is allocated to design, development, testing, deployment and support of the various apps and the web sites and social media platforms over the first 9 months. The start-up INDTB! in-house staff is (and will be), small, and we will be paying for professional expertise in public relations and promotion as well as web and social media presence management. Puzzle editing (yes, we have to assure there aren't copies of other people's work and that content is suitable for our user base), will be outsourced, too. We believe a realistic number of users will be ~4 million in the first year.Please watch the video to see a demonstration mock-up of how the games will be played and find out more about the features and plans, then join us on the road to exciting new gaming fun!"

No ruled or dotted pages also means that transferring your sketches to a computer will not include any unwanted dots or lines that will be troublesome to omit. Copper functional elements:For those on the move, we have placed a copper strip front and back to protect the corners of your notebook from blunting.We chose copper because of the beautiful natural patina that will develop over time, which has been the inspiration for celebrated architectural facades around the world.The dimensions of the copper protector were derived through the golden ratio, which leaves us with a perfectly proportioned design that we feel is timeless.Pricing: Early Bird Launch DiscountFor our Kickstarter Early Bird Rewards, our Architools Notebook will launch for SGD 20 and our Architools Copper Notebook will launch for SGD 25.

Food deserts impact affluent, middle, and low-income communities across the country.

IMPACT: We’ve created an innovative service offering for our grocery store that supports healthy lifestyles, drive down healthcare cost, drive product sales, inform new product development and, foster customer loyalty. Food deserts increase the risk factors associated with chronic diseases while creating food insecurity for the overall area. With the spiraling cost of healthcare reaching 3 trillion in 2015, chronic diseases contributed to 86% of those healthcare costs. Public policy makers argue that preventing disease by promoting better dietary habits is an absolute policy choice for our future. Our theory, reduce the risk factors associated with chronic diseases and curb the cost of healthcare community by community. Family Tree Market is a grocery retail and health service provider. Our goal is to improve the way the food industry responds to meeting the needs of our communities. Given that lifestyle choices such as poor diet and a lack of exercise have been connected to chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease, we believe that the food industry has a role to play in the fight against chronic diseases. The Family Tree Market business model enables us lower the risk factors associated with chronic diseases by incorporating behavior modification programs at the point of consumption in the communities we serve. Family Tree Market is a shift in the way we view grocery stores and its role in the fight against chronic diseases. Your initial giving will enable us to open our first store.

In the spirit of giving I have begun combing the area for worthy causes to donate to as well as investing in the children of single mothers, that they may have a proper education that has been robbed our high school graduates short of robbing them of their pell grants.  I have 3 objectives for this next year. One) To provide enough customers for my vendors that they can make an actual profit in attending our event versus anothers. Two) To raise awareness to the plight thrusted upon women in the workforce. Three) To invest in the future of our country by focusing on a proper education for our children as well as investing in women entrepreneurs that seize every opportunity to become successful business women.  These are my goals, I believe they aren't just worthy of investment but they are critical to the growth of our country from our rank academically versus the world and our economic gap that is ever growing disproportionate to the extent of snapping our social system back nearly 100 years.

Digital Art,"""0""","{I started digitally re-mastering kid’s drawings back in 2009 when a friend asked me to take a look at one of his son’s pictures. They were thrilled to see the first results. So I did a few more.My friend's son sent me a card to say thank you and coined the term 'Monstews' - Monsters created by Stew (me). That's where the name and logo comes from.A few years later my daughter started producing her own awesome artwork - I decided to try and 'Monstew' a few. She loved the results.It seems kids love to see their drawings coloured in the lines by a grown up. So I'm opening Monstews up to Kickstarter - For the kid in your life who loves to draw and would love to see a new take on one of their pictures. NOTE: There are no physical products on offer here - all the files I send by email or Dropbox will be digital - so it will be up to you to get prints of the pictures. Don't say I didn't tell you. A PDF poster that looks like this (except with your kid's image): JPG looks likes this (except with your kid's image): I have to add a clause that says my artwork is final - I'm probably not going to have the time to make a million changes once I've sent the final image. It's possible that if you ask me nicely I might make one or two changes here and there within reason, but you get my drift - you're decent people. If the image I receive is overly complex it means it's going to take me a lot longer to work on. That being the case, if I take a look at an image and am like ""Say whaaat - this is going to take me days not hours?"" then I might have to get in touch and request a different image. I'm only human! If you back this project I'll presume you have read to and agree to this.  The original image is not owned by me. By requesting that I Monstew your kid's image, you are agreeing that the Monstew version of that image is mine and I have the copyright to use it as I see fit by which I mean make a PDF of all the Monstews when I've finished them and send the PDF to all the backers, post it on my website, Facebook and other Social Media channels, print it, display it publicly and generally use it for promotion as I choose. This is not an exhaustive list. I'm never going to include any personal details other than the first name and age of the child. If you don't like the terms I am proposing then please don't ask me to do a Monstew. If you do back this project for me to produce a Monstew, I take that as acceptance of these terms. Basically I don't want any legal disagreements to arise on the basis of digitising kids drawings - so it's written here to cover my behind. Again, I know you're the good guys, so I don't need to preach to the choir. If you want to opt out of me using the Monstew for my own promotion, feel free to write to me and explain it to me. I'm a reasonable person. I don't want to tread on people's toes. How about we stay in touch? Join my mailing list over at monstews.com and I can keep you in the loop about stuff like Monstews and other projects I'm working on that might be interesting.  }","Wed, December 6 2017 6:00 PM EST",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/370915270/commission-monstews-series-two,{},$20,{NZ$ 30;NZ$ 40;NZ$ 40;NZ$ 40;NZ$ 30;NZ$ 40;NZ$ 40;NZ$ 40;NZ$ 30;NZ$ 40;NZ$ 40;NZ$ 40;NZ$ 30;NZ$ 40;NZ$ 40;NZ$ 40;},0.0,"Marlborough, NZ",16,,Commission Monstews - Series Two by Stewart Wiggins —

Handcraft is time consuming and demanding, but the result is worth it: the quality of our bags is exceptional.We believe in using only high quality materials and we also believe that unique things make our lives better.The name of the studio, AncestorWorld, is our way of showing respect to our heritage, it brings us back to the times when plastic did not exist and our ancestors build their houses and made their clothes using only natural materials. Our bags look even better in real life than in the pictures.

Josh raised $230K almost immediately. We think that as a community we can raise $100,000 to help complete the purchase of the Bears Ears Education Center.Any additional funding would go towards renovating, staffing and creation of the exhibits. Fundraising efforts will continue into 2018, but unless we close this gap by the end of the year, there won't be a place to create the visitor and education center. Together as a community, we need to put our money and our time where our hashtags are. Together, let’s build something real.Friends of Cedar Mesa wants to purchase this former bar in Bluff, UT to be  transformed into the Bears Ears Education Center. Wide open mesas and slot canyons. Petroglyphs and splitter cracks.Below, a few of the images available for prints at certain reward levels.     Donations of $25 or more are tax-deductible.

Digital Art,"""0""","{I started digitally re-mastering kid’s drawings back in 2009 when a friend asked me to take a look at one of his son’s pictures. They were thrilled to see the first results. So I did a few more.My friend's son sent me a card to say thank you and coined the term 'Monstews' - Monsters created by Stew (me). That's where the name and logo comes from.A few years later my daughter started producing her own awesome artwork - I decided to try and 'Monstew' a few. She loved the results.It seems kids love to see their drawings coloured in the lines by a grown up. So I'm opening Monstews up to Kickstarter - For the kid in your life who loves to draw and would love to see a new take on one of their pictures. NOTE: There are no physical products on offer here - all the files I send by email or Dropbox will be digital - so it will be up to you to get prints of the pictures. Don't say I didn't tell you. A PDF poster that looks like this (except with your kid's image): JPG looks likes this (except with your kid's image): I have to add a clause that says my artwork is final - I'm probably not going to have the time to make a million changes once I've sent the final image. It's possible that if you ask me nicely I might make one or two changes here and there within reason, but you get my drift - you're decent people. If the image I receive is overly complex it means it's going to take me a lot longer to work on. That being the case, if I take a look at an image and am like ""Say whaaat - this is going to take me days not hours?"" then I might have to get in touch and request a different image. I'm only human! If you back this project I'll presume you have read to and agree to this.  The original image is not owned by me. By requesting that I Monstew your kid's image, you are agreeing that the Monstew version of that image is mine and I have the copyright to use it as I see fit by which I mean make a PDF of all the Monstews when I've finished them and send the PDF to all the backers, post it on my website, Facebook and other Social Media channels, print it, display it publicly and generally use it for promotion as I choose. This is not an exhaustive list. I'm never going to include any personal details other than the first name and age of the child. If you don't like the terms I am proposing then please don't ask me to do a Monstew. If you do back this project for me to produce a Monstew, I take that as acceptance of these terms. Basically I don't want any legal disagreements to arise on the basis of digitising kids drawings - so it's written here to cover my behind. Again, I know you're the good guys, so I don't need to preach to the choir. If you want to opt out of me using the Monstew for my own promotion, feel free to write to me and explain it to me. I'm a reasonable person. I don't want to tread on people's toes. How about we stay in touch? Join my mailing list over at monstews.com and I can keep you in the loop about stuff like Monstews and other projects I'm working on that might be interesting.  }","Wed, December 6 2017 6:00 PM EST",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/370915270/commission-monstews-series-two,{},$20,{NZ$ 30;NZ$ 40;NZ$ 40;NZ$ 40;NZ$ 30;NZ$ 40;NZ$ 40;NZ$ 40;NZ$ 30;NZ$ 40;NZ$ 40;NZ$ 40;NZ$ 30;NZ$ 40;NZ$ 40;NZ$ 40;},0.0,"Marlborough, NZ",16,,Commission Monstews - Series Two by Stewart Wiggins —

In the spirit of giving I have begun combing the area for worthy causes to donate to as well as investing in the children of single mothers, that they may have a proper education that has been robbed our high school graduates short of robbing them of their pell grants.  I have 3 objectives for this next year. One) To provide enough customers for my vendors that they can make an actual profit in attending our event versus anothers. Two) To raise awareness to the plight thrusted upon women in the workforce. Three) To invest in the future of our country by focusing on a proper education for our children as well as investing in women entrepreneurs that seize every opportunity to become successful business women.  These are my goals, I believe they aren't just worthy of investment but they are critical to the growth of our country from our rank academically versus the world and our economic gap that is ever growing disproportionate to the extent of snapping our social system back nearly 100 years.

Handcraft is time consuming and demanding, but the result is worth it: the quality of our bags is exceptional.We believe in using only high quality materials and we also believe that unique things make our lives better.The name of the studio, AncestorWorld, is our way of showing respect to our heritage, it brings us back to the times when plastic did not exist and our ancestors build their houses and made their clothes using only natural materials. Our bags look even better in real life than in the pictures.

We need to echo the call Berta Cáceres made when she received the Goldman Environmental Prize: ""Awaken Humanity, we are out of time"", so that her murder and the assassinations of hundreds of land defenders is marked with the definitive closure of the company DESA, the builder of the hydroelectric plant on the Gualcarque river which is opposed by the Lenca people of Honduras.*COPINH Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras        Mataron al personaje del documental en el que estaba trabajando. Berta y yo imaginamos juntas las tomas aéreas sobre el río Gualcarque con las que finaliza Berta Vive y que lamentablemente ella ya no pudo ver. El asesinato de la compañera Berta Cáceres me plantea el compromiso ineludible de producir un filme que contribuya, desde la misma propuesta de producción, al esclarecimiento del caso.BERTA SOY YO es sin duda el proyecto de mayor responsabilidad en mi vida. Estuve con ella el día anterior a su asesinato y tengo en mis manos el cuaderno donde dibujó el mapa del río Gualcarque y escribí sus indicaciones de qué intereses estaban conspirando en su contra. Con cada palabra de Berta me comprometo a llevar adelante esta historia.Katia Lara / Directora| They murdered the character of the documentary I was working on.Berta and I imagined together the aerial shots on the Gualcarque river that close out the short documentary Berta Vive. Regrettably Berta would never see those shots realized. The murder of Berta Cáceres raises the inescapable commitment to produce a film that contributes, from the very nature of the production, to find the facts and clarification in the legal case.I AM BERTA is without a doubt the project of greatest responsibility and commitment in my life. I was with her the day before her murder and I have in my hands the notebook where she drew the map of the Gualcarque river and wrote her indications of what interests were conspiring against her. With every word of Berta, I pledge to carry this story forward.Katia Lara / Director  Es imperioso seguir denunciando a empresas transnacionales y sus socios locales que instalan “industrias energéticas verdes” amenazando la vida de comunidades indígenas en todo el mundo, que no son consultadas para utilizar sus territorios.BERTA SOY YO es un relato construido con la fuerza de la indignación mundial que continúa exigiendo respuesta a las preguntas que arroja su asesinato. ¿Quién era Berta? ¿A quiénes amenazaba su trabajo? ¿Qué intereses se confabularon para asesinarla? Contamos con un archivo invaluable, más de 100 horas de material registrado desde el 2013, sobre Berta Cáceres y la lucha del Consejo Cívico de Organizaciones Populares e Indígenas de Honduras COPINH, la organización fundada por Berta que ahora dirige su hija Bertha Zúniga Cáceres.| It's imperative to continue to calling out the transnational corporations and their local partners who install ""green energy industries” which threaten the lives of Indigenous communities throughout the world. These communities are not consulted about extractive projects to use their territories and resources. I AM BERTA is a story built with the strength of the global outrage that continues to demand an answer to the questions that resulted in her murder. Who was Berta? Who was threatened by her work? What interests conspired to kill her? We have invaluable footage, more than 100 hours of recorded video material since 2013, featuring Berta Cáceres and the struggle of the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH), the organization founded by Berta and now led by her daughter Bertha Zúniga Cáceres. El proyecto inició con la producción urgente del cortometraje Berta Vive, un filme de 30 minutos realizado en apenas cinco meses, con el fin de rendir un homenaje a Berta, sumarnos al duelo mundial por su vil asesinato, y sobre todo, señalar a los responsables de su judicialización y amenazas de muerte que ella misma denunció. Katia Lara conoció a Berta en 2008, cubriendo la huelga de hambre de los fiscales, una lucha emblemática contra la corrupción en Honduras. Más tarde, durante el golpe de Estado de 2009, Berta fue una de las primeras voces de la resistencia incluidas en nuestro documental Quién dijo miedo. Desde el 2013, Katia ha filmado la lucha del COPINH contra la construcción de la represa Agua Zarca en el río Gualcarque.| This project began with the urgent production of the short film Berta Vive, a 30-minute film made in just five months, in order to pay tribute to Berta. This short film joined the world in mourning for Berta’s vile murder, and above all, to bring to justice those responsible for the prosecution and death threats that she denounced. Katia Lara met Berta in 2008, covering the hunger strike of district attorneys, an emblematic struggle against corruption in Honduras. Later, during the Honduran coup d'etat of 2009, Berta was one of the first voices of resistance included in our documentary We are not afraid (Quien Dijo Miedo). Since 2013, Katia has been filming COPINH’s struggle against the construction of the Zarca Water dam the Gualcarque river.   La trascendencia del proyecto, la responsabilidad con que lo asumimos, y la credibilidad de Katia Lara como directora, ha posibilitado reunir a profesionales de varios países, quienes tenemos en común una historia de trabajo por los derechos humanos y las luchas sociales, y el compromiso de hacer una película a la altura de Berta Cáceres.| The significance of the project, the responsibility which we assume, and the credibility of Katia Lara as director, has made it possible to bring together professionals from various countries, who have the experience and commitment working for human rights and social struggles, and the commitment to make a film to the height of Berta Cáceres.bertasoyyo@tercoproducciones.com |  bertasoyyo.com | bertasoyyo.com/iambertaKatia Lara - HONDURAS | Guionista y Directora | Writer and Director [+]Milton Benítez - HONDURAS| Investigador Principal |  Main Researcher [+]Sam Vinal - ESTADOS UNIDOS | Productor | Producer [+]Almudena Bernabeu - ESPAÑA | Abogada Internacional | International Lawyer [+]Gustavo Castro - MÉXICO | Sociólogo y Ambientalista | Sociologist and environmentalist [+]Miriam Miranda - HONDURAS | Coordinadora Organización Fraternal Negra Hondureña | Coordinator of The Black Fraternal Organization of Honduras  [+]Irina Ruiz - PANAMÁ | Productora Ejecutiva | Executive Producer [+]Nuestro documental será filmado en Honduras, Estados Unidos y España, con técnicos de alto nivel procedentes de varios países.

Project We Love,"""727""","{ While you take a minute or two to look over the campaign, click on the link below to download our prototype demo!    Inspired by the golden era of skateboarding, the early 90s and early 2000, Session's primary goal is to make you experience what skateboarding really is; an incredible sport where there are no other goals other than expressing your creativity and achieving success through hard work, perseverance and bits of madness for no one else other than yourself. The main purpose of the game is to live the sport in its entirety. Feel what it is to be a talented street skater.  Explore and tame the concrete, film yourself, your friends and share your footage on the internet with the worldwide skateboarding community.Session focuses on the authenticity of skating, both in the way the game feels and is presented to the player.  Based on this philosophy, each feature makes the game even more innovative, fun and respectful to the skateboarding culture.  In Session each stick represents your feet.  From there, every skateboard is your instruction manual.  Just think about how you would move your feet or transfer your weight while on a skateboard and apply that to the sticks. In Session it’s not only a matter of getting on your grinds but it’s also important to work on finding the sweet spot in order to keep your balance, slide longer and have it steezy! Putting too much weight on the wheels while sliding will slow you down, reduce your ''pop out'' or eventually end up with a wheel bite. On the other hand, if you don't put enough weight, you'll end up falling or losing your trick. Eventually, you'll be able to apply some wax to reach greater distances but remember, it won't fix all your problems! Focus on what skateboarding really is! If a handrail inspires you to do a backside lipslide, then so be it! We won’t dictate which tricks are worth more. But if you really feel like getting recognition for your hard work, share it and maybe you’ll become a virtual pro skater.  Filming has always been a big part of the skateboarding culture. Session will feature an extended video editor that will allow the player to perform their tricks; edit, create a montage in-game and share it through all the most popular social media platforms (available social media platforms will vary depending on chosen game platform). Time to setup your spot lights! Whether you want to nail that rail gap as dawn light shines over the city, or are looking to tear up a pool at midnight, you can pick your prime skating time.Have your filmer friend ready and rip some sick night footage!  Those late night sessions are the best!  Session is not just another skateboarding game. It is something that will live on and grow with the community and with those who wish to get involved. Join us and turn Session into the most authentic game that represents what the skateboarding culture really is.Everyone’s unique, we know it but skaters need to show their colors. This is part of the skate culture and it’s no different in Session. From the type of the cap you wear, to the colors of your bolts, you'll have access to in-depth character and skateboard customization to show off your style!Session In-Game Character Model by crea-ture Studios on Sketchfab  Session’s progression system rewards those who repeat, persevere and keep trying. The more you do your tricks, the more consistent you become, the higher the pop, the easier the catch will be and more!The progression system in Session is based on what you do and how often.  For example, if you keep doing kickflips, you're gonna get better at it. You'll be able to flip faster when you need to, pop higher and have an easier time catching your trick. This way your skills will continuously open new venues and spots to shred!  However, if you think everything you gain stays forever, you're wrong! Like any other athlete, if you don't keep practicing, you'll lose that edge! Build a better tomorrow, with us! Session is built upon the concept of city hubs that will grow on a regular basis and evolve based on your feedback.With the help of heat maps and in-game feedback tools, we'll have useful information about skater habits across the cities, the most skated spots and what they like or don't like. This will help us identify what we should be fixing or modifying first! A spot sucks? Let us know, we’ll put construction signs for a couple weeks and we'll fix it. This skate plaza is always empty? Development metrics will tell us why and we'll redo it.     Every city hubs are directly inspired by real life cities with accurate and to-scale reproductions of their most legendary and best skate spots. Have a spot you want to see? Let us know! Session is the right place to be vocal.   Skate with friends online, have a game of skate on the couch, film a big part with your filmer friends or simply go to your favorite secret hubba and have a session! The filmer mode allows a second player to follow their skater friends online and film their performance live during the session. It also lets the player record movies easily while following their friends and find the best angles without feeling overwhelmed.  It's designed to help the player feel like a professional cameraman, with presets such as auto-follow, auto target, optimal angles and much more.                        Marc-Andre Houde, skate addict, Stuck in the 90s , he's had better years but is still skating. He's this uncle who still dresses like a teenager, refuses to grow up and builds mini ramps on Sunday afternoon with his kids while neighbors mow their grass and clean their driveways. 15+ years game developer for several renowned game studios in Montreal, his expertise includes 3D animation and modeling, artistic, animation and creative direction for games and team management.

We just wanted to make sure it was the right time and that we had something for you guys to try and play around with.  Now is that time. Although we have already managed to secure some funds to bring Session to Steam Early Access and Xbox Game Preview, we felt that given a little more resources we could give Session that extra edge before putting it into your hands.We know we still have a lot of work ahead of us and we need your support to bring this game to the next level.

Project We Love,"""317""","{FALL OF GODS is a series of cinematic illustrated novels, set in a realm inspired by Norse mythology1670 backers helped us launch FALL OF GODS here at kickstarter with a massive roar - So huge, that 20th Century Fox picked it up, now developing it into a feature film. Now the saga continues in The Nomad; volume two in the planned trilogy;The Eldest have awakened from their age-old slumber and Midgard and Jotunheim are at the brink of war. When Vali learns of a legendary Jotun witch who can bring back his wife from the dead, he travels North, across a realm torn by fear and xenophobia. But he soon finds himself on a collision course with Rolf Krake, Midgard’s cunning and war-mongering high chieftain, who may hold the key to Vali’s dark past - and the truth about the demon who dwells inside him.      Fall of Gods - the Nomad is the exhilarating sequel to Fall of Gods - She Is Gone, combining the written novel with epic illustration.   Our unique approach to the book medium, is combining the massive amount of illustration with the written novel on every spread of the book. It gives an immersive experience, rarely found in books - we call it a cinematic novel. Fall of Gods - the Nomad is 11.7 x 8.7"", 144 pages. Fall of Gods logo on frontcover will be debossed.      You can add the following products to your pledge, at a discounted price. These will be delivered together with your copy of Fall of Gods, at no extra shipping cost. Please note that you can only order addons if you are a backer at level STANDARD or above.To buy an addon, click the Manage My Pledge button and increase your pledge manually with the total cost (in US $) for the addons you want. Your total pledge also needs to cover the shipping. When this Kickstarter is over, we will send out a backer survey in which you can mark exactly which addons you want. Brimstone: The Demon Within is a contemporary coming-of-age tale set in a treacherous realm that exists beneath our world. It is the story of a gifted girl thrust into a wilderness of wonder and terror, where she is forced to face her deepest fears. We have teamed up with Hollywood screenwriter Will Simmons to create this epic dark fantasy universe. The book is 156 pages, hardcover, and was successfully funded on kickstarter. See the campaign HEREFall of gods - She is Gone was our first Cinematic Novel, and we have learned a lot since then. We are really grateful for all the feedback we have received from our backers. We listened to your great thoughts on the book and redesigned our book format, for our second project, Brimstone.As soon as we saw it, we knew had found a better format to communicate our vision, and show the enhanced quality in story, illustration and layout.We know it is not ideal to have the first volume in another format than the second, but we need to make this change to create a stunning product that can hold up in the future. At some point we hope to do the entire trilogy in this format.You get more illustrations, more pages and a bigger format..Here is a comparison of the two volumes:   Fall of Gods started as a passion project- a collaboration between Art Director and co-founder of MOOD Rasmus Berggreen and Hitman writer Michael Vogt - and you all helped us get the story out to the world. MOOD is an entertainment design agency, located in Copenhagen, Denmark. At MOOD we love designing universes and building worlds for the biggest brands. See more here: moodvisuals.comOur world class team at MOOD is doing all the artwork, and it will be stunning. MOOD is also handling layout and print, to deliver a quality product to you.  We are so excited that 20th century Fox is developing Fall of Gods into an epic motion picture! Maze Runner director Wes Ball is attached to direct the movie and the script has been adapted by Stuart Beattie, writer of Pirates of the Caribbean, Collateral, 30 days of night and many more.    The story is already written and the storyboard done for the entire book. We need your support to finish the Artwork and layout, printing of the book and shipping. We want to give you the coolest book possible and that comes with a cost. This is how we plan our budget:  We are really excited to have been invited to Kickstarter's DRIP.
Drip is a subscription platform, where creators can share their creative work and release ongoing content for the subscribers.It is the perfect place for us to show all the work that goes into creating our universes, and to give exclusive content and updates for backers.

Project We Love,"""79""","{I'm Tommy McCutchon and I started Unseen Worlds with my good friend Neil Fauerso in Austin, Texas in 2006.  We created the Unseen Worlds label under the guiding principle that deeply-affecting, worldview-altering avant-garde music can come in the form of highly accessible records. These records transform the fabric of our every day lives in a way that is benevolent and non-escapist, allowing them to be easily overlooked while they deserve to be treated with the same care and attention as commercial, canonical, and popular favorites.Nearing the end of our tenth year releasing music, I'm extremely thankful for all the great artists and records Unseen Worlds has had the honor of working with over these years, and how we have been able to work alongside the artists together to establish ourselves as a label that has and continues to encourage and inspire other distinctive, creative viewpoints and outlets.If you're not yet familiar with our work, there have been a few recent features on Unseen Worlds as a label in the past year:""the label’s divergent releases, which can be engaging, strange, fiercely experimental, devotedly classicist—the list of modifiers goes on. Each release has a distinctive sound and a distinguished history, many of them unknown."" - Andy Battaglia, from Bandcamp Daily""[Unseen Worlds] trades in environmental music of the highest order; music that benefits substantially from considered listens, a critical arsenal, and an understanding of historical context"" - Nicholas Zurko, from Zurkonic""Their reissues and archival releases occupy the present with such grace, that you forget they are works of the past."" - Bradford Bailey, from The HumOur $10K goal represents approximately the cost of doing a single full-scale release from Unseen Worlds from start to finish. In the case of a bigger project like the Carl Stone Electronic Works from the Seventies and Eighties 3LP set, or our Laurie Spiegel The Expanding Universe collection, it's just a portion. As Unseen Worlds has grown as a record label, so has our need for a greater investment of time and resources into each project. We are also still in the process of incorporating vinyl pressings into our new projects and back catalog, which are generally two to three times as expensive as CD pressings to produce. Typically, running the label strictly from our own profits, the occasional grant, and whatever we can scrape together from our modest day jobs makes this transition extremely slow, even though we keep an extremely lean overhead. The funds raised with this Kickstarter will help us gain momentum going into the new year, helping us make progress on the curve of our release schedule and growing production times and vinyl manufacturing costs. Any additional funds raised in this campaign beyond our goal will make it that much more possible for us to get more projects into motion and more back catalog titles back into print on vinyl.We hope that you can help support our efforts at this time, and please help spread the word if you have the opportunity.Side A)  Laurie Spiegel & Don Christensen (The Contortions, impLOG) ""Donnie + Laurie"" (recorded circa late 1970s, Spiegel on Electrocomp 101, Christensen on drums)Side B) Laurie Spiegel ""Patchwork"" (Alternate Version)""Androgeny""""Wild About The Lady""   Laurie Spiegel for providing us with two very special tracks to include on a Kickster-only 12"" record, to David Rosenboom for the vintage J.

Project We Love,"""76""","{New Orleans.But that's changing! And it's thanks to a bunch of skaters who refused to give up.They were so tired of begging for a public skatepark, they went ahead and started building their own, without any permits. And something amazing happened.City hall decided to take a chance on the skaters. As a result, the park is now totally legal and up to code. Check out how far we've come in 3 years:With your help, we're about to start Phase 4, a huge ramp and peanut pool at the front of the park, right next to Paris Avenue. And if we raise enough money, we're also going to fix the flats, the area along the fence line.Want to help out? We've made all this cool stuff you can get. Every penny goes toward the new ramps!                 We're three years into the build, and the space is so big that we're just getting started. Right now, we're looking for support for an interconnected ramp and peanut pool. Once it's done, Phase 4, as it's known around here, will tie the whole transition zone together.How much of the money goes to construction? Every penny. It's as simple as that. We have no overhead—we're all volunteers, and we don't pay rent—so every dollar goes to concrete and rebar.Once we're done with Phase 4, will the park be finished? Not by a long shot! We'll still have 30,000 square feet of beautiful concrete slab ahead of us.Our story starts in 2008, when a group of young skateboarders found the perfect place to skate: a big concrete slab, hidden by trees, a highway, and some railroad tracks. The skaters pooled their lunch money, and the ramps grew slowly, one $3 bag of Quikrete at a time. The Peach Orchard was instantly legendary. But it didn't last long. In May 2012, bulldozers sent by the railroad flattened the park in a matter of minutes.New Orleans went back to being the biggest U.S. city without a public skatepark. Once again, it seemed like skateboarders just didn't have any friends.Two weeks later, bruised and battered, the skaters started rebuilding—just a few yards away, on blighted public land under a highway. They grabbed shovels and rakes, and bit by bit, they transformed a trash-strewn dumping ground into a spot that the kids from the neighborhood could safely call their own. A new skatepark started going up on Paris Avenue. They called it Parisite.At the same time, other skaters started making trips to City Hall—a lot of trips. In fact, they spent a year trudging down every corridor, having conversations with people at every level of city government. What they found surprised them: people who were willing to take a chance on skateboarders. And after some paperwork—and some very honest talk about what was expected of us—the city legalized the skatepark and gave us the green light to improve it: it was beyond our wildest dreams.Why should anyone care that New Orleans has no skatepark? Skateboarding—when properly counted—is the #3 youth sport in the U.S.: that means more kids have skateboards than have baseball gloves. And yet what has New Orleans done for its 16,000 skateboarders? It's not crazy to connect the lack of skate spots for city kids with high rates of street violence, juvenile arrests and youth obesity.The youth have spoken back: we want durable concrete infrastructure designed by and for us. Radical minds in city hall have given us the green light to try. They're curious to see if we'll hold up our end of the deal—and you can bet they're watching to see how much community support we get.Parisite is more than a skatepark. We've planned it that way. Parisite's site-wide landscaping catches storm water coming from the interstate above, feeding rain gardens full of native plants. Runoff-neutral site design helps prevent localized flooding and lessens the burden on nearby pumping stations. Skateboarding was born in concrete drainage channels, and we believe that a skatepark that addresses water management and promotes zero-emission transportation makes for a more resilient New Orleans.The last time we did a Kickstarter, we hit our goal and we delivered. In fact, we went above and beyond what we said we'd do. That's our style. If you give, you won't be alone. We've already gotten support from Spohn Ranch Skateparks, which donated an entire street course, and from Tulane University, whose school of architecture built an entrance to the park as a gift to New Orleans skaters.We've also gotten support from the Tony Hawk Foundation, the Arts Council of New Orleans, Platforms Fund, Black Rock Arts Foundation, and from football player Drew Brees.Most of all, we have the support of the New Orleans Recreation Development Commission, Mayor Mitch Landrieu, and the Capital Projects Administration, all of whom have taken a big chance on us.

Project We Love,"""69""","{In this age of isolation, when so many of us are increasingly fixated on screens and shiny new objects rather than on connection and on compassion, it is no surprise that we are plagued by an epidemic of addiction. If addiction is an adaptation to a poverty of the spirit, then we will remain malnourished and bonded to our addiction until we can deeply connect to self, to source, and to community. In the midst of an international crisis of overdose deaths and suicide, questions about how we authentically connect with ourselves and each other in the face of this isolation are increasingly urgent.Cura is a feature length documentary in progress that tells the story of Yolanda and Donny, a mother and son who break cycles of addiction and violence in the face of impossible odds. At a time when lawmakers leave no choice for impoverished Americans but to crowdfund their own surgeries, Yolanda and Donny's story of taking their mental healthcare into their own hands is more critical than ever. Their story illuminates both the spiritual and communal aspects of healing from trauma, as well as the stark socioeconomic realities that often prevent it for many marginalized people.

The film is a passion project of director Ethan Goldwater that — over the past two and a half years — has amassed a team of dedicated and influential individuals from the worlds of healing, public policy, and film. The story begins in the shadow of the structural injustice and violence at the heart of American inequality. Yolanda and her sons all grew up in southern California’s Inland Empire, amidst fear of family violence, the spectre of raids by law enforcement, and constant financial instability. Growing up with parents who used and sold heroin throughout her childhood, Yolanda herself developed a regular meth habit at age 16. Years later, her sons began using meth at younger ages than she did.

Over a decade ago, Yolanda moved to the California Bay Area to get away from her toxic environment. When her sons joined her there, they had both already been in and out of juvenile detention and prison, struggling to navigate a world that criminalizes trauma and many of the mechanisms people use to cope with it. We began filming Cura soon after Yolanda's younger son Johnny died from a preventable meth overdose in an Oakland jail in 2015. In Cura, she strives to save her surviving son Donny, who also struggles with addiction, depression, and PTSD.However, our film is about more than oppression and struggle - it is a story of healing and reclamation. Cura follows Yolanda and Donny as they utilize ancient, innovative, and visionary medicine to heal the trauma and break out of cycles of addiction and violence that have plagued their family and community for generations.A message from director and producer Ethan Goldwater:“Yolanda and I met in a sacred meditation community about 5 years ago and became fast friends. I was blown away many times over by Yolanda’s uncanny story and her unfathomable strength. Soon after she lost her son Johnny in March 2015, I asked her if she was interested in sharing her story. Yolanda agreed, and since then, we have worked to integrate with Yolanda’s healing process, using the storytelling process as a medium for her to process her grief and healing. As Yolanda and Donny's story unfolded, others in the community - Ismail, Alessandra, Jan, Max, Tara, Derek, Allen and Chris - have joined to help tell their story with integrity and power. Yolanda courageously opened up her life to our cameras, allowing us to capture her and Donny's challenges combating addiction, violence, and poverty. We’ve been there through the small everyday moments, filmed in ceremony and in jail. We’ve held the camera through the course of Yolanda’s legal case against Alameda County and the CHP. Their story - filled with triumph and tragedy - demonstrates how even in the midst of intergenerational trauma, healing can always be accessed through community, commitment, and ceremony.""By helping Yolanda and Donny tell their own story, we hope to show how community-based, integrative medicine can intervene at opportune moments, even within otherwise intractable patterns of crisis. Together, we are now ready to share this story with the world.Cura's story is both heartbreaking and transcendent; it is both a stark look at the unjust and brutal reality for many people of color in America, and also a testament to the human spirit in the face of that reality. At its core, Cura shows that transformative and tangible healing is possible for every person who seeks it. We hope that Yolanda's story can inspire others to heal themselves, too.We need your help now to make this film a reality.

After more than two years of filming, we have over 150 hours of footage to cut, and are now prepared to work with editors that will take this film to its final stages. The funds from this Kickstarter will go to shoot final scenes with Yolanda and Donny, mix sound, and edit our footage into a final cut.

 Cura has been 100% independently filmed and produced so far, but now we need your generous donation to help us take it to the next level.

Help us expand the public conversation around healing and social justice by sharing Yolanda, Johnny, and Donny’s story. Our world needs Cura's powerful message of love, healing, and triumph.Cura’s crew is a dream team of seasoned film producers, expert social justice and drug policy influencers, visionary cinematographers, award winning editors, and much more. Cura is poised to make waves artistically, as well as socio-politically, throughout the worlds of drug policy, social justice, and public health.Ethan Goldwater (Director, Producer, Cinematographer)  is a filmmaker who was raised in a big family by social workers who showed him what it means to get involved in the lives of others. His work as a filmmaker builds on his prior careers as a journalist in San Francisco, and as public school teacher in NYC. He has created work for organizations such as BRAC, IMEU, UNICEF, Dell Innovation Foundation, Drug Policy Alliance, and New Schools Venture Fund, and taught workshops in Bangladesh, Palestine, Uganda, and Ghana aimed at empowering people to use filmmaking as a tool for telling their stories. His short film the Last Waterman of Wittman was selected as a Vimeo staff pick in 2011 and played at the Chesapeake film festival and Camden film festival. He produced The Long Road Home, a TV-special documentary about double amputee tractor puller Larry Koester. In 2014, he founded Hover Pictures, a production company dedicated to making explorative documentary and narrative work and supporting directors to bring new films to life. His recent short film Lady Bountiful premiered at SF Indie Fest and will be broadcast on KQED’s series Truly, CA.Ismail Ali (Co-Producer) is a multiracial Muslim-American advocate with a depth of lived experience and personal interest at the intersection of social marginalization and drug policy. Ismail presently works as Policy & Advocacy Counsel at the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), where he helps develop and advocate for just, equitable, and creative alternatives to the failed War on Drugs. Ismail also serves as Vice-Chair of the Students for Sensible Drug Policy Board of Directors. Ismail earned his J.D. at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law in 2016 after focusing his studies on metaphysics, ethics, and Islamic law as a philosophy student at California State University, Fresno. While in law school, among leading and participating in extracurricular activities which focused primarily on human rights, civil liberties, and racial justice, he also worked for the ACLU of Northern California’s Criminal Justice and Drug Policy Project. Ismail believes that plant medicine and psychedelic consciousness has a crucial role to play in challenging oppression in all of its forms.Tara Marchant (Co-Producer) is the Director of the Oakland Emerald Cities Collaborative, working across a host of stakeholder organizations (public, labor, community and industry and workforce development) to bring a collective effort to retrofit our urban core. In doing so, create jobs, build our democracy, reduce energy use, and direct investments to our local communities. Even in her early career pathway, having graduated from Yale University in Theater and French, she saw herself as an artist in the complex narrative called life. Her calling was to create stories and visions, dramas and comedies where the audience, through these works, could aspire to reach higher. She joined her union, performed in TV and Theater. And when she worked, was paid well because of the value her union represented in her craft. However, Tara found that success through performance was limited –she was a woman and a person of color. It taught her that hard work and diligence doesn’t guarantee success: that systems are difficult to manage, and navigate. And old paradigms and old hierarchies were not reflecting the changes needed to include new voices, new cultures and new innovations. It is with the spirit of introducing new voices in important conversations in the Bay Area and throughout California, and connecting to established institutions working to change the dominant social paradigms, that Tara advises Cura.Steve Holmgren (Consulting Producer) is a producer and curator in the arts, working primarily in independent cinema, and has worked with Matthew Porterfield (Putty Hill); I Used to Be Darker), Marie Losier (The Ballad of Genesis and Lady Jaye), Cory McAbee (Crazy & Thief), as well as on the omnibus project Far from Afghanistan (featuring John Gianvito, Soon-Mi Yoo, Minda Martin, Jon Jost, Afghan Voices, and Travis Wilkerson). Holmgren is the head of the advisory committee for the nonprofit documentary arts organization UnionDocs, for which he served as programmer from 2009-14. In that capacity, he organized hundreds of screenings, panels, and workshops.

Holmgren has additionally been a visiting professor at Pratt Institute as well as participating at forums including IFP New York, Sundance, Berlin, Rotterdam, and Visible Evidence.Max Basch (Cinematographer) came from a background in photography which reflects in his framing as a documentarian. He recently has shot and directed a number of music video projects for the likes of Zoe Kravitz and Benjamin Clementine and has had the honor of working with other artists such as Prince, and Beyoncé. Currently, he's in the process of finishing a feature length documentary on the life of painter, Kenny Scharf.Alessandra Lacorazza (Editor) is a queer Colombian-American filmmaker and editor based in Brooklyn NY. Her work deals with both personal and cultural memory, and incorporates themes of resilience, migration, community and alienation. She creates work where identities intersect and form dualities. Recently, she directed a music video for artist Julia Weldon, featured in NYLON, OUT, and GO Magazine, which pays homage to queer bodies, queer spaces, and the latinx lives lost in the Pulse nightclub shooting. As an editor, Alessandra has focused her work on the latinx community in the US and in Latin America.

Project We Love,"""99""","{*Para leer en español busca abajo de esta página.In an immersive experience that we will take to communities across the United States, Skylight will share how to use the cinematic and storytelling arts in movement building. We seek to exchange ideas and reach newly engaged activists and local grassroots organizations by sharing the tactics and knowledge from over 35 years of impact storytelling. As The Resistance Saga tour rolls out, we see an opportunity to form a broad intersectional network of solidarity that gathers force across issues, campaigns and movements.From climate justice, indigenous rights to women’s rights, Black Lives Matter, LGBTQ rights, or immigration reform, Skylight is committed to the long-term defense of human liberty. We strive to build spaces that foster solidarity, empower and energize activists, and create networks for action that will repel the present and looming assaults on our rights.At each stop, local movement organizations-in-resistance will be our hosts: providing venues, inviting participants from their communities and sharing their experiences. The day-long events will be anchored by a screening of Skylight’s most recent film, 500 YEARS (Sundance Premiere 2017), and will also include sessions with other films drawn from the Skylight archives and tailored to the issues most pressing in the host communities. We will hold sessions in collaboration with local movement organizations as well as filmmakers/artists to explore the various ways in which our work serves as a form of resistance. One of the workshops will focus on sharing the Skylight model of human rights media activism in order to discuss how storytelling can create and strengthen social impact. Central to the event will be a political action forum led by the remarkable Mayan women protagonists of 500 YEARS, Andrea Ixchíu and Irma Alicia Velásquez Nimatuj.The day will conclude with a rousing concert by invited local musicians and fast-rising Mayan singer/songwriter Sara Curruchich, celebrating the resilience and beauty of the human spirit!In so many ways, indigenous peoples all over the Americas have set a powerful example of long-term courage and strategic activism against daunting odds, such as in the saga of the Mayan people depicted in the trilogy of Skylight films: When the Mountains Tremble, Granito: How to Nail a Dictator and now 500 YEARS. Through the Mayan perspective, The Resistance Saga reminds us that resistance is not a quick fix nor a definitive victory. Our rights are never guaranteed, and we must always defend them, nurture them, strengthen them.  To #Resist is a stance, it’s an attitude, it’s a way of life.The Resistance Saga tour is set to launch in the Spring of 2018. We believe it's important for this event to be free and open to the public so the funds we raise here are crucial. We hope you join the movement and help us make The Resistance Saga tour a reality. THANK YOU! Below is the 500 YEARS theatrical poster offered as one of our rewards!The Resistance Saga trilogy films created by Skylight's co-founders, Director Pamela Yates and Editor Peter Kinoy, have premiered at the Sundance Film Festival during the past 35 years.When the Mountains Tremble (1982) introduced indigenous rights leader Rigoberta Menchú as the storyteller in her role to expose repression during Guatemala’s brutal armed conflict. Winner of the Special Jury Award at Sundance, the film was seen worldwide and translated into 10 languages. It helped put Menchú on the world stage and 10 years later she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Yates’ sequel, Granito: How to Nail a Dictator (2011) is a political thriller detailing international efforts to build a genocide case against Guatemalan General Efraín Ríos Montt. The case included outtakes from When the Mountains Tremble as forensic evidence in the prosecution of Montt. The third film, 500 YEARS: Life in Resistance (2017), picks up where Granito leaves off, providing inside access to the first trial in the history of the Americas to prosecute the genocide of indigenous people. Driven by universal themes of justice, power and corruption, the film provides a platform for the majority indigenous Mayan population, which is now poised to reimagine their society.*Get the download of one or all three films as part of our Rewards!

Buscamos intercambiar ideas y ponernos en contacto con activistas recién comprometidos y organizaciones locales de base compartiendo las tácticas y el conocimiento de más de 35 años de contar historias de impacto. A medida que se desarrolla la gira de La Saga de la Resistencia, vemos la oportunidad de formar una amplia red interseccional y de solidaridad que reúne fuerza a través de los temas, las campañas y los movimientos sociales.Desde la justicia climática, derechos de los indígenas a los derechos de las mujeres, Black Lives Matter, derechos LGBTQ o reforma migratoria, Skylight está comprometida con la defensa a largo plazo de la libertad humana. Nos esforzamos por crear espacios que fomenten la solidaridad, empoderen y vigoricen a los activistas, y que creen redes de acción que repelen los presentes asaltos amenazantes en contra de nuestros derechos humanos.En cada parada, las organizaciones de movimientos locales en resistencia serán nuestros anfitriones: proporcionarán lugares, invitarán a los participantes de sus comunidades y compartirán sus experiencias.Los eventos de un día estarán anclados con una proyección de la película más reciente de Skylight, 500 AÑOS (Sundance Premiere 2017), y también incluirán sesiones con otras películas de los archivos de Skylight y adaptadas a los temas más relevantes a las comunidades anfitrionas.Realizaremos sesiones en colaboración con organizaciones de movimientos locales, así como con cineastas / artistas para explorar las diversas formas en que nuestro trabajo sirve como una forma de resistencia. Uno de los talleres se centrará en compartir el modelo Skylight de activismo de medios de comunicación y derechos humanos con el fin de discutir cómo la narración de historias puede crear y fortalecer el impacto social. El evento contará con un foro de acción política protagonizado por las notables protagonistas mayas de 500 AÑOS, Andrea Ixchíu e Irma Alicia Velásquez Nimatuj.El día concluirá con un entusiasta concierto de los músicos locales invitados y la cantante y compositora maya de rápido crecimiento Sara Curruchich, que celebra la resistencia y la belleza del espíritu humano.En muchos sentidos, los pueblos indígenas de todas las Américas han establecido un poderoso ejemplo de valentía a largo plazo y activismo estratégico contra viento y marea, como en la saga del pueblo maya representada en la trilogía de las películas de Skylight: Cuando las montañas tiemblan, Granito: Cómo atrapar un dictador y ahora 500 AÑOS.A través de la perspectiva maya, La Saga de la Resistencia nos recuerda que la resistencia no es una solución rápida ni una victoria definitiva. Nuestros derechos nunca están garantizados, y siempre debemos defenderlos, nutrirlos, fortalecerlos. #Resistir es una postura, es una actitud, es una forma de vida.La gira de La Saga de la Resistencia se lanzará en la primavera del 2018. Creemos que es importante que este evento sea gratuito y abierto al público, por lo que los fondos que recaudamos aquí son cruciales. Esperamos que te unas al movimiento y nos ayudes a hacer que la gira de La Saga de la Resistencia sea una realidad. ¡GRACIAS!Viajes para los protagonistas, los panelistas y el equipo: pasajes aéreos, alojamiento, alquiler de automóviles, comida, cargos por equipaje, tarifas de estacionamiento, taxis, seguro, combustible, etc. Producción: costos del lugar, producción de música, seguro de producción, servicios públicos, consumibles, alquileres de equipo, tarifas de artistas, bebidas y comida para los participantes del evento, entre muchas otras cosas. Sobre las películas en la trilogía La Saga de la Resistencia - Las películas de la trilogía de La Saga de la Resistencia, creadas por los co-fundadores de Skylight, Pamela Yates, directora y Peter Kinoy, Editor, se han estrenado en el Festival de Cine de Sundance durante los últimos 35 años. Cuando las montañas tiemblan (1982) presentó a la líder de derechos indígenas Rigoberta Menchú como la narradora en su papel de exponer la represión durante el brutal conflicto armado en Guatemala. Ganadora del Premio Especial del Jurado en Sundance, la película fue vista en todo el mundo y traducida a 10 idiomas. Ayudó a poner a Menchú en el escenario mundial y 10 años después fue galardonada con el Premio Nobel de la Paz. La secuela de Yates, Granito: ¿Cómo atrapar a un dictador? (2011) es un thriller político que detalla los esfuerzos internacionales para construir un caso de genocidio contra el general guatemalteco Efraín Ríos Montt.

Project We Love,"""666""","{Now that our initial goal has been achieved - IN THREE DAYS! - it's time for some STRETCH GOALS...more Stretch Goals coming soon...Space Command is a bold, retro science fiction series with all the hope and optimism of yesteryear combined with the eye-popping visual effects of today, as well as past and present superstar sci-fi actors.It is the vision of creator Marc Scott Zicree who has amassed countless writing credits in shows such as Star Trek: The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine, Sliders, Babylon 5, Friday the 13th, The Real Ghostbuster, Smurfs, He-Man, and Superfriends.  
Space Command is the story of Captain Jack Kemmer and his stalwart crew aboard a starship vessel called The Paladin. In the first installment, Space Command: Redemption, Captain Kemmer rescues ex-archeologist Vonn O'Dara high above Mars, setting into motion a revolution that changes galactic history.     Once Redemption (parts 1-4) is funded, all additional funds will go to funding the completion of Forgiveness, which includes a group of new, incredible stars.   Some of the up-and-coming sci-fi stars in Space Command Redemption:   Marc & Elaine Zicree have written and produced hundreds of hours of series TV, pilots and feature films for most of the major studios and networks, including Paramount, Universal, Disney, Sony/Columbia Tri-Star, MGM, Warners, Castle Rock, New Line, CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox, WB, UPN, Showtime, PBS, Turner, USA Networks, Syfy, Discovery, Nickelodeon, the BBC, Marvel, Scholastic, ITV and NPR. Among their credits are classic episodes of Star Trek – The Next Generation, Sliders, Babylon 5, Deep Space Nine, Friday the 13th – The Series, Smurfs, Superfriends, He-Man, Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future, The Littles, Forever Knight, Liberty’s Kids and The Real Ghostbusters, among many others. Marc and Elaine’s work has been nominated for the Hugo Award, American Book Award, Humanitas Prize, Nebula Award and Diane Thomas Award, and has won the prestigious Hamptons Prize, TV Guide Award, Rondo and Saturn Awards. In 2014, Marc was named a Writers Guild Diversity Honoree.                 A word from creator, Marc Zicree:""As a kid I loved STAR TREK, TWILIGHT ZONE, OUTER LIMITS, FORBIDDEN PLANET and grew up to write for such great shows as STAR TREK – THE NEXT GENERATION, DEEP SPACE NINE, BABYLON 5, SLIDERS and more.I often hear fans say, “Why are there so few good sci-fi shows on TV, and why do so many go south?” I can tell you – frankly, most of the network suits just don’t get it.But you and I do.So when I recently got the idea of creating a new show inspired by the sense of wonder and possibility science fiction gave me as a kid, I realized I didn’t need a network or studio to make my dream come true -- just Kickstarter and you.Thanks for making it happen.""  We cannot do this without you. You can support us financially, or just by helping us spread the word. Here are additional ways you can help:But rest assured, every dollar secured will go to completing Space Command! We've already got the first TWO HOURS shot - that's all of Space Command Redemption! And now we need a bit more to finish all of the incredible visual effects and release it to you, the public! Our first goal of $39,000 is to complete Part One of Space Command: Redemption. Once that is achieved, we will move on to Parts Two, Three, and Four. And after that will be Space Command: Forgiveness! When we raise enough to complete visual effects and post-production on Redemption, Parts 1-4, any and all remaining funds will go to completing the next episodes, Space Command Forgiveness- much of which has already been shot and looks amazing!

Project We Love,"""95""","{ I've spent a lot of time in the last decade recording on other artists projects as a hired gun. If there's one thing I love, it's being in the studio. Session work is the best kind of work there is as far as i'm concerned, with live performance coming in a close second. I'm always happy and grateful to find myself wearing a pair of headphones whilst standing in front of a microphone. While I have enjoyed the challenge of working within someone else's vision and viewing the song through another artist's eyes, as the years tick ever more quickly by, I've felt a growing longing to once again embark on my own musical journey and be the master of my own sonic destiny. I want to once again take some of my favorite musicians, stick them in a room and see what magic happens. And make no mistake, music IS magic. A guitar riff pulled from the ether... A lyric on the breeze... Something from nothing... Making the impossible seem possible...That's where you come in. This Winter I hope to head back into the studio to record and release my fourth solo album. I'm excited to announce that Dominic John Davis (Jack White, Buddy Miller, North MIssissippi Allstars) will be stepping into the role of Producer and I'm so ecstatic to have him on my team for this project. He's played bass on every solo album I've made and I know we can make something really special if we can just get the funding to pay the musicians, engineers, graphic designers, cd manufacturers etc the living wages they deserve.In addition to Dominic on bass, some of the other core band members on this project will be Drew Howard on all things stringed, Mike Lynch on all things keyed, and Geoff Ian Lewis keeping the time on percussion. There are some exciting guests who will be making an appearance on the album too, but that's a surprise for another day.I hope you'll take a minute to check out the fun rewards being offered up in exchange for your patronage and I wanna thank you for even just taking the time to read this message. It takes a village and I appreciate your consdieration!Video CreditsHUGE Thank-you to Michael McCallum at Rebel Pictures for making the Kickstarter video happen on a short timetable.

She’s had a difficult upbringing and values stability, which she gets in the form of consistent paychecks from a job that doesn’t allow her to use her voice. She thinks in the future she’ll be able to write stories from her own perspective. Throughout the course of the series, Simone must learn to speak up in uncomfortable spaces.SASHA has a carefree personality and is uninterested in what the future holds as long as the now is enjoyable. She was accustomed to men paying for her lifestyle, but now lives on her friends’ couch. She must learn how to rely on herself, instead of on her friends and men to take care of her.GENEVIEVE is a people pleaser who has always followed the path her parents set out for her. Her art has struggled to take off, making her question if her parents were right all along. She’s also realizing that her supposed asexuality is actually an untapped attraction to women. Genevieve must learn how to choose herself and her desires over other people’s wants and wishes.THE GROWTH OF GROWN  As a young black woman, creator Janea West wanted to use her experiences to make a show that felt real - that showed growing up in all of its complexities. Driven by her own insecurities with identity and race, and frustrated with the incomplete representation of black women on screen, she decided to write stories she would want to watch. This is when she put together a team who shared her vision and passions. Together, they have developed a series showcasing real stories about women growing into their own.WHERE WE ARE NOW & WHY WE NEED YOU Scripts are complete, actors have been cast, our production team is ready and all we need is YOU!

Join us in creating GROWN the web series!WHO WE AREJANEA WEST (Creator/Writer/Executive Producer) is a creative writer/producer based out of Washington, D.C. Driven by questions about race and her own identity, West began writing stories on black womanhood in college. It wasn't until she worked in television as a production assistant that she decided to pursue TV writing as a career, a decision that soon after birthed GROWN. Upon acceptance into a selective cohort of eight for Columbia University's TV Writing Program, West decided to turn the pilot idea into a web series with hopes to streamline the creative process. Inspired by Toni Morrison’s words, “if there’s a book that you want to read, but it hasn’t been written yet, you must be the one to write it.” Janea is determined to bring strong, relatable characters to the screen.CHARLOTTE LAN STEINER (Story Editor & Executive Producer) is a writer/producer born and raised in the D.C. area. After graduating from Middlebury College with a degree in Film and Chinese, she spent several years working at an international production company and on indie productions in Shanghai and Hong Kong, respectively. She's part Chinese, so her time in China also served as an exploration of her questions about race and identity. She has written and produced several of her own shorts and attended a TV writing intensive at Columbia this summer where she and Janea met and decided to collaborate. Charlotte wants to tell stories that are specific, funny and honest, which is what she believes GROWN is.ELNATAN ""E"" MELAKU (Cinematographer & Editor) Born and raised in Ethiopia, he's been working as a videographer and editor in the DC area for the past two years. When he and Janea met at a youth poetry slam, they connected immediately over their shared value of amplifying authentic stories for the sake of reflecting the human experience. His passion is creating purposeful and emotionally-charged visual content.KASHARENA HORTON (Production Manager) is a published scholar in public health who has worked with LGBTQ communities, sex workers, and various communities of color. Her incredible organizational skills and attention to detail are invaluable additions to GROWN. Kasha has always had a passion for film and is excited to be working at the intersection of art and activism.SKYE ELLIS (Creative Director) is dedicated to applying her experience to work that amplifies voices that are often muted in society. Her experience extends across multiple artistic avenues, including direction of the cultural arts department at the Boys and Girls Club and social marketing at a nonprofit STEM literacy organization in Boston, Massachusetts. She has also been acting for over a decade. Ellis draws from personal experiences living and working in underserved communities. Thus, she aims to build and strengthen community relationships by connecting oppressed populations to cultural arts around the world.EVERY BIT HELPS!If you like what you see, help us spread the word!

Project We Love,"""440""","{*********************************************************************************$50,000 STRETCH GOAL NOW UNDERWAY. IF WE REACH THE GOAL, WE'LL ADD SIX MORE SONGS TO THE HOLIDAY DISC, FOR A GRAND TOTAL OF 18 SONGS.*********************************************************************************$35,000 STRETCH GOAL VOTE IS OVER.  THESE TWO SONGS ARE ADDED TO THE ACOUSTIC SHOW SETSYNTHESIZERYOUR HEAT IS RISING********************************************************************************Over the years,Electric Six has given its fans insight into many sides of its creative world.  Besides the regular studio albums the band releases, Electric Six has recorded multiple live records.  It's recorded cover albums.  It's done live show DVDs and rarities collections.  It's even done a doc (or is that mock?)umentary.  However the well is not dry. Electric Six is thrilled to be offering fans something yet again different and unique in its catalogue to fans interested in pledging.  For the first time ever, Electric Six will be recording a collection of holiday songs.  A few years back, we did a recording of the theme song from ""How The Grinch Saved Christmas"" for the AV Club (part of The Onion's comedy and culture empire) and every year when we post it we get tremendous reactions from you, the Crazies. We believe the time is right to pull together an entire collection of holiday favorites, and to do it we need YOU to be involved. You'll see how as you examine the reward packages to the right of this page. We're offering pledgers the chance to pick some of the songs we'll do.  We're even offering to record an ORIGINAL holiday themed song for this record, where you can have some input as to the specifics of the subject matter. Collectively, this disc will be entitled ""A Very Electric SiXmas""  We've already identified a few of the songs we'll do...Silver Bells  Father Christmas (Kinks)You're A Mean One Mr. GrinchChristmas Card from A Hooker in Minneapolis/Silent Night  (Tom Waits)Grandma Got Run Over By A ReindeerThe rest will be filled out by us and  you, the Crazies. We're anticipating a 12 song record.Yet, that's not the only thing we're doing   As is usual for us in these projects, we're doing a two disc set.  So disc one is the holiday record. Disc two is going to be another new endeavor for us. We're going to do a full band acoustic set here in Detroit, and we're going to record it as part of this release. Of course Dick Valentine has performed solo acoustic shows for many years  but this will be something different. This will be more akin to the old MTV Unplugged sessions.  Do you remember when Stone Temple Pilots did an MTV Unplugged? It'll be a lot like that, but even better, because it'll feature songs exclusively from the Electric Six catalog. Imagine, DaVe and Nashinal on acoustic guitars.  Tait? on a REAL piano. The mind reels with the possibilities.  As part of this, we'll offer many of the usual things we tend to do when we have a live recording as part of  a Kickstarter project...we'll let folks determine some songs we'll do, perform on stage with us during the set, etc. Believe it or not, this will be one of the more complicated and potentially exhilarating things we've ever attempted, so we're excited to let all of you be a part of it. This disc will be entitled ""Chill Out!""  We're going to perform this show at Small's (DaVe's bar) in Hamtramck, Michigan on March 21, 2018.  The set will include these songs, with many, many more to be added of course:McDonnellz  Pink Flamingos  Show Me What Your Lights Mean  Steal Your Bones  Big Red ArthurSYNTHESIZER (Stretch goal addition)YOUR HEAT IS RISING (Stretch goal addition)We're bringing back some tried and true packages which we know you all love.  So, yes, the exclusive t-shirt, poster, etc. will all be available.  We'll also do similar things to what we've done in the past in enabling pledgers to become part of the recording and/or show process. So there will be room for you to select songs for either record, or perform either in the studio with us on the holiday record or at the live show in Hamtramck. Our Karaoke disc was so wildly successful that we're doing a Volume 2, with an entirely new set of songs for you to drunkenly sing along with. Of course we're also bringing back some of the Dick Valentine favorites...if you love the idea of a DV crafted mix CD or having your portrait drawn by him or your tarot cards read, those are back in the mix as well this time around.  Yet, we're bringing some new ideas into the fold as well. Ever wanted your very own E6 Christmas stocking, complete with your name customized on top? Now it's available.  How about a set of Dick Valentine drawn holiday cards? Your friends and family will never know what hit them!  We're also, for the first time, offering a Dick Valentine stained glass night light, created by our friends at Glass Action. Light up your life with DV!Pledgers may notice that a handful of packages which have previously been very popular (Soundcheck Experience, Dinner and a Producer and You Choose The Encore) have either been reduced in availability, seen a price raise, or both.  The simple explanation for this is that, though we've enjoyed providing these packages for you over the years, they all have taken a great toll on Electric Six. Learning entirely ""new"" songs multiple times in a tour or having time to prepare for a show cut drastically short has started to strain Electric Six's sanity.  So, we're cutting back on those this time, but we've still made a few available for you if you REALLY want them.We're also bringing back the E6 Subscription Club for a second round! This will function in exactly the same way as it did last time. For an extra $20 added to your pledge, you'll receive a quarterly (so that's 4 times a year, delivered electronically approximately every 3 months) collection of material.  It will include demos of songs being developed for the next Electric Six studio record, so you'll get an early sense of where that record is headed and follow along as the song is developed.  It may also include things like alternate or remix versions of new material. We'll also include the odd outtake or live recording...as an example the band did a live recording in Austin, Texas this past spring and may send some of that material to Club members. We'll also include exclusive photos, etc. Additionally, we're going to include any cover selections or remix selections made by pledgers in this campaign as part of the Subscription Club...so all members will get those sent to them as well as the other material mentioned above. PLEASE NOTE: If you subscribed as part of the ""You're Welcome!"" Kickstarter campaign, your subscription will expire with the material to be sent out at the end of 2017. So, if you want to continue to receive all the great stuff which is part of this club, you'll need to pledge for it in THIS campaign with $20 added to your pledge (or you get it for free if you've pledged for any package of $500 or more).We're really excited about ""A Very Electric SiXmas & Chill Out!"" Now,  just to be clear, it's going to take us awhile to pull all this together, so this will be delivered in October of 2018 (not in time for THIS holiday season, of course). The holiday season is about family among other things and Electric Six IS YOUR FAMILY NOW. Electric Six gonna make everything merry and bright, and then it's gonna take things down a level and cool out with non-electric versions of E6 favorites which will blow your mind. REMEMBER, the ONLY way you can get this set is to pledge in this campaign.  It is exclusive to this Kickstarter. Take a psychological sleigh ride with Electric Six...become a part of ""A Very Electric SiXmas & Chill Out!""}","Thu, December 21 2017 8:43 AM EST",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/e6absolutetreasure/a-very-electric-sixmas-and-chill-out,"{Synthesizer and Jimmy carter;SYNTHESIZER

Synthesizer please!!!;Thanks for your prompt and positive response! I'm so pleased to hear of your commitment to both the Kickstarter ecosystem and the underlying spirit of Kickstarter. :-);@anneCwind: we use the Kickstarter system. We’ve done five campaigns (counting this one) and have never asked a pledger for additional money after the campaign has closed, nor have we ever used any external system for collecting information;Are you planning on using the Kickstarter reward surveys to collect information? As a Superbacker I have been disturbed by the practice of Creators using external surveys that then ask for an additional payment for the Backer reward because of the Creator's unexpected expenses. These same surveys also offer ""add-ons"" and other products. Kickstarter is not a retail space. I don't appreciate Backers that treat it as one. Since I have yet to come across this practice with a Creator that uses the reward survey system provided by Kickstarter, I've recently decided to only back Creators that plan on using it.
